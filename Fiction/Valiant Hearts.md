In her dad's basement she finds a formula that describes the reaction that Chlorine gas (The ones Germans use during this war) with the hydrogen within a person's lungs.

### Chapter 3 - Poppy fields
<span style="color:brown">Freddie was killed by the explosion inside the fortress.</span>
Another depressingly ironic fact, is that <span style="color:gray">Emile </span> is writing letters to <span style="color:#1e589c">Marie</span> about all these incidents, when <span style="color:#1e589c">Marie</span> can't send anything to his name.

<span style="color:green">For the past 4 months Karl has been walking from the prison camp all the way to Vaubecourt, with the motive of reaching St. Mihiel. He is starving. He once attempted to ask for help but his accent reveals his German roots.</span> (I don't understand why he keeps the German uniform)

Saint Mihiel has had cut communications for the past 4 months, not allowing <span style="color:#1e589c">Marie</span> to communicate with anyone else.

<span style="color:green">After Karl rescues a child from the wolves, her parents treat Karl's hunger.

Seems that <span style="color:#1e589c">Marie gave Victor the single gas mask they had, as she is passed out. 
</span>Karl removes his gas mask to drag her body out of the house. </span>

<span style="color:gray"> Emile has been very sick, but the French general needed every man to launch his war-deceicive big offensive against the Germans in Chemin des Dames.</span>

<span style="color:gray">The general made very austere demands that were consecutively leading to one soldier's death after the other. Forcing the soldiers right into gunfire, by threatening them with (very risky) warning shots. As Emile was injured by a strike, and the general walks by his body, Emile gets a sneak heavy blow on the general using his shovel.</span>
After mutiny, the offensive was abandonded. 
Emile was imprisoned for treason, awaiting his court-martial.

<span style="color:gray">Emile gets publicly executed, thinking that his son-in-law is dead, and that he let his daughter and grandson down.</span>
