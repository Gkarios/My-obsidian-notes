## Plot
### Chapter 1
Ayumi & co prank Satoshi by arranging a fake ghost story come-to-life scare. Their school is a renovation of an old haunted school.

Since Mayu is transferring out, Ayumi convinces everyone to take a demonic vow for eternal friendship by ripping a piece of paper and keeping it. She warns that if anyone fails the vow, something unfortunate may occur. After the vow, a massive earthquake happens, and breaks down the classroom.

Naomi and Seiko find themselves inside the old haunted dilapidated school, suggesting supernatural effects have taken place. They find a ghost of a dead skeleton. The skeleton claims the place they are inside of is a multi-dimensional nexus cursed by vengeful spirits, that they are confined within this space. Their friends are also abducted, but within a different space. They find the ghost of a child-spirit and a painting depicting a figure chasing 4 other figures with scissors.

According to a forbidden newspaper, a male schizo teacher was found alive holding a pair of scissors near dead kidnapped corpses of children. The corpses had the tongues cut off and many other mutilations.

Naomi and Seiko lie down at the infirmary, and talk about Naomi's crush on Satoshi, Seiko goes to look around the school as Naomi awaits for her ankle to heal. Naomi finds herself trapped in the infirmary with an deadly apparition chasing her. Naomi finds Seiko, they fight and split up. The floor between them collapses. Seiko apparently also has a secret crush on Satoshi. Seiko follows a mysterious voice that drives her to hang herself inside the 4th bathroom stall she had previously taken a shit inside of. Naomi finds Seiko's corpse hanging from the ceiling and sobs.
### Chapter 2
Ms. Yui goes to investigate Naomi's scream as she leaves Ayumi and Yushiki in the classroom.
She hears the multi-dimensional lore and finds an orange spirit that tells her everyone will die off starvation or suicide. Tells Ms. Yui that the feeling you have when you die, will be felt for all eternity and seemingly kills her.

Yushiki and Ayumi find a deadly ghost-child. Ayumi is very out of character, as if hypnotized. Entering the infirmary, they find Mayu surrounded by two ghost-children, outside the infirmary they meet Naho, a dead paranormalisst author that died inside this nexus. 

Naho suggests that the 4 missing children of the newspaper/drawings are responsible for this. And that the way to open the bounds of the nexus would need the sorrow and agony of these children to heal. In order to satisfy the children, they need to find the murderer, who is also in this space, and make them remorseful for the killings. 

They find a Penitent Spirit doll that belongs to the murderer and bring it to the ghosts. The ghosts kill Mayu by throwing her to the wall, Ayumi runs upstairs in a fit of rage. Some hooded man (Kills?/Kidnaps?) Yoshiki. Ms. Yui regains consciousness, the spirit ensures her 9 people in total have recently appeared, including her. She is able to exit the classroom.

### Chapter 3
**shitty flashback of 3 kids happens**

Naomi sees Naho enter the lavatory, they barely talk. 

Satoshi and Yuka are informed by a spirit that the rest of the class is within the nexus. They hear Naomi and see Yoshiki's blood trails. Yuka wants to pee, but the bathroom floor is missing. They come across Morishige who tells them to split.
Satoshi and Yuka go to a school across, see the weird person from the intro and a person in a trance. Yuka goes to pee on the plants but sees a ghost, Satoshi disappears.

Yuka finds Morishige next to the fresh corpse of intro girl. She runs into Yuuya Kizami who is another student who has lost his younger sister. The hooded man killing students is also the killer of the ghosts. Kizami walks Yuki to the bathroom and his friend Kurosaki appears. They talk about intro girl's corpse until Kizami abruptly stabs Kurosaki. 

Satoshi wakes up from a knocked-out state, finds a note that reports the death of 3 children found within a concealed room inside Heavenly Host, a barely conscious 4th child and an adult, the principal's jovial son who was holding scissors and was later charged for the murders through the surviving kid's testimony and taken into an asylum. He was unemployed due to his inability to speak and ever-growing disability that made him behave child-like and play with a doll. After several months, the suspect managed to abscond the facility, ran to Heavenly Host and killed himself by hanging. The one victim that survived him was a girl in a red dress from a different school, unlike the 3 dead victims from Heavenly Host. Heavenly Host then was the host for countless incidences of rape, molestation and suicide (lol), and was forced to shut down. The principal went insane, painted his school in graffiti and jumped off the roof.

Satoshi walks into Noha, who tells him someone had fucked up the curse from the group and doomed everyone. She then controls Satoshi's body and laughs hysterically.

### Chapter 4
Seiko has a younger brother Yuu, who experiences a massive earthquake in the bathroom.

A flashback of Mayu occurs, we can see that before her death, she had lost her sheet of paper similarly to Seiko.

Satoshi wakes up, finds Naomi hanging herself similarly to Seiko, but because of his god-given rng gametes, he manages to save her life. Naomi confirms for Seiko that she was hypnotized and not conscious during the suicide attempt. 

We are given a flashback of Kizami as a child. He is spewing edgy slurs and torturing his best friend's pet before attempting to kill it. He hates and cusses out his sister.

Yuka can't piss in the stalls because they are filled with 6 students that hanged themselves (lol). Kizami, as he inspects the bathroom, can't contain his laughter at the sadistic loss of innocent children's lives. Very edgy. Apparently Kizami always dreamed of having a younger sister so he can either treating her well or rape her, it's hard to tell which one, which suggests he lied to Yuka about having a younger sister but also explains why he keeps her alive. 

Ayumi finds Naho and Yoshiki. Yoshiki says he was struck in the head by a big guy, dragged in a room and later saved by someone. Naho essentially confirms the big guy/killer is Kizami. And says the doll malfunctioned because of his evil lack of remorse and love for torturing the innocent. Naho commands they turn the doll to Kizami while screaming and breaking all the glass in proximity.

Yoshiki & Ayumi return the tongue to the ghost, an earthquake happens shuttering that dimension. Naomi mouth-kisses Seiko's spirit. 

Satoshi & Naomi read a newspaper that reports Yoshikazu, the son of Heavenly Host's principal

Ayumi is told to hypnotized to drown. Yoshiki saves her. They find a note "That bitch killed my friends. She can spend eternity without a tongue, for all I care!". They return 2 more tongues with the help of Morishige playing with Mayu's corpse, and the children warp them back to their school.

The school is still haunted, however, and they are told by one of the ghosts that they'll have to return to release the rest of the classmates. The ghost makes Ayumi run a simulation of the killings. Ayumi finds out the murderer was the surviving "victim" that gave the only testimony against Yoshikazu that framed him. Likewise, Satoshi and Naomi read a detective journal that follows the conjecture that Yoshikazu is being manipulated or outright framed, and that both his crime and his father's suicide were completely unanticipated. 

### Chapter 5
After Kizami's friend screams, Kizami starts hysterically laughing in front of Yuka and says he is her older brother. Yuka notices his lack of sanity runs away. Ayumi claims that Kizami was also in the room with the red dress killer as an accomplish and he was shaking in fear.

Satoshi gets hit by the roof collapsing during another earthquake. 

Yoshiki & Ayuma find out the truth and get in a fight because Yoshiki doesn't want more liability for the two of them, confessing his love for Ayuma. 

Opinion: 
(Because of bad writing, this is expressed as Yoshiki's jealousy towards Satoshi.) In reality Yoshiki has very strong reasons to not risk his or Ayumi's life let alone TRUST the child-ghost that repeatedly tried to kill them. This dilemma should not be placed in the same question as mere "love jealousy" to mystify Yoshiki's decision to the player.

Ayuma is disappointed by his perspective and abruptly makes the decision to travel back to the nexus alone.

For the first time, Yoshiki & Ayumi meet Satoshi & Naomi within the nexus. Satoshi & Naomi find the bodies of a dead colleague and the mentor of Naho, according to their tape, they can redo the charm and return to their real school. They also find Yuka.

Yoshiki & Ayumi read journals of Naho. Ayumi confronts her and speculates that she rigged the charm on purpose so that a plethora of students transfer in the nexus with the motive being a larger sample size for her mentor's study who she deeply affectionate for. Naho was also the one that killed her mentor and colleague, (not sure why). According to her notes, the charm will only work once Sachiko (red dress girl) repents.

Morishige after finding out his sister's death kills himself by jumping off the upper floor. 

Satoshi goes to investigate a hallway, inside the room across is Sachiko's mom, Yoshie. They read her diary that reports the principal sexually assaulting Yoshie and strangling Sachiko to death. This took place 20 years before 'Sachiko's kidnapping' (PLOT ARMOR? NO BIRTH RECORDS?). 

According to the diary, Sachiko has been killing children so that their souls can get along with her dead mom's soul. And after many killings, she is now a psychopath.

(Plot hole? Why wasn't this noticed before?) The principal is stuck in an infinite loop of killing himself. 

The floor collapses, Ms. Yui "saves" Ayumi and the only reason she dies is because there isn't enough time and strength, the floor will collapse. In spite of this, Ms. Yui gives a whole motivational speech while grabbing onto the ledge surviving long enough to finish the speech, and falls to her death.

Naomi separates herself from the group and watches a tape that reveals that under black magic, she hang Seiko herself. As she is hopeless after watching the tape Seiko from the afterlife motivates her to move on. The rest of the group finds Sechiko, brings her the items and does the chant to return back to their normal school. The five surviving children live the rest of their lives as if nothing happened and nobody at the school has any memory of the existence of any of the dead people.
