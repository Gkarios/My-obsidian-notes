# Intro
James Sunderland is looking for his wife, who sent a letter telling James that she is waiting for him in Silent hill, in their "secret place". James notes that his wife Mary has been dead for years.

He enters Silent Hill with a map of the town. As he walks through the foggy graveyard, he meets an Angela, who is looking for her mother. Angela seems very stressed, untrustworthy and odd.

James enters the town as he sees a figure in the fog, he follows it

Three needles stand in three different heights.
The fat, the tall and the thin. From slow to fast they move to the right. Scott rests not on three, but fifteen.

Henry (9.5)
Mildred (2)
Scott (3.5)

The clock is stopped at 1:04 and 15 seconds.
The face plate is closed. It is locked.

The scars of the past shall move the nail that stops time.

First lies the seat of
He who is Peerless
Silent and empty, 
heartless and fearless
Beside him sits one who knows
The place of the servant is 
next to the throne.
Dozens of feet, yet not a single toe 
The One that is Hidden
beside him doth go
Seducer of dreams,
creature of Hades
Lying further from 
Man and closer to Lady.
Man and Woman seeing all
Heedless to the Raven's call.
Silent and Hidden the two may be
They be not there for you to see
Return them to whence they would be
And blessing shall descend on thee
I speak thus with the North Star behind me
The birth of the sun is the start of the story

There is a line of five 1-inch round depressions set into the table.

In the trash:
"The police announced today that Walter Sullivan, who was arrested on the 18th of this month for the brutal murder of Billy locane and his sister Miriam, committed suicide in his jail cell early on the morning of the 22nd.
According to the police statement, Sullivan used a soup spoon to stab himself in the neck, severing his carotid artery. By the time the guard discovered him, Sullivan was dead from blood loss, the spoon buried two inches in his neck.
An old schoolmate of Walter Sullivan's from his hometown of Pleasant River said 'He didn't look like the type of guy who would kill kids.
But I do remember that just before they arrested him he was blurting out all sorts of stange stuff like 'He's trying to kill me. He's trying to punish me. The monster... the red devil. Forgive me. I did it, but it wasn't me!'
The schoolmate then added 'I guess now that i think of it, he was kinda crazy."

#### Exam room
The pin number this month is "T". Last month it was "X" and before that it was "Z". But what are they going to do next month? That's all they can express with 4 numbers. Anyway, does the door to the Patient Wing really need to have its combination changed this often?

I do not wish to die. But tomorrow I will climb the thirteen steps. Please someone - answer me, why must I die come the morning? The man imprisoned beside me believed me. "Because they're all insane, that's why," he said. Of course I know his opinion will change nothing. "Now you know why I struck out at them," he muttered. The man who was executed yesterday, the one who had said his job was to sell dreams, said that was not true. But the man who is to be executed the day after tomorrow for stealing children shouted back that it was true. The man who was hung today did not answer. "They'll kill me either way," he said. He was caught embezzling money, so he hasn't any hope for mercy. The man who is always quietly smiling to himself said "I am happy for I will soon be with her."
I do not wish to die. I long only to return home. But I know it is not to be. Though I have done nothing, this crime has been thrust upon me. Someone save me. This is not judgement. They are bloodthirsty and I am their sacrificial lamb!

Only the sinless one can help you here. Mistakenly pull on a criminal's rope and your reward will be returned to you in a shape most wondrously strange.
