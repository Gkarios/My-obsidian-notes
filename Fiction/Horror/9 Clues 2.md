July 1954

# Act I
MC and detective britbonger from last game are now private investigators.

"it's coming; it knows; please help us"

Britbonger traces the phone call and they go after it, over to the Mnemosyne Asylum, by travelling to Mnemosyne island.

Nobody else is entering the island.

Apparently bonger is MC's boss named Owen Duffer, they decided to quit state employment for max profit.

The Asylum is trashed, not accepting new patients.

They talk with the desk staff, french accent Klaudia Kreuz, who is also in charge of the asylum. She doesn't believe Owen about the phone call they received. Sounds very suspicious and cold.

They watch a therapist named Crow defenestrate from the upper window and fall to his death. He has a note on him "I deserve this pain, this punishment." "I know believe Gordon, it's coming". Gordon is one of his patients.

MC finds a nurse named Ashley, seems distressed from the incident.

A fire happened in 1950, which caused the "father's facility" to close off and financial status of the firm to deteriorate. A grave outside the facility had "1950" as a date of death.

There's an unsettling statue next to Crow's office. Also a couple of Mnemosyne (= the ancient Greek goddess of memory) statues outside.

Crow's door is carefully locked. Inside, MC concludes that Crow opened a box, dropped it to the floor and was murdered by someone who scarred on the wall "Ginger". In the box, is a scarecrow doll, making a distinct noise and pushing out the word "Guilty", which is similar to the letter found on Crow.

Crow also kept Owen's number written down, indicating he called them to help. Also found Gordon Lefty's medical records containing alcohol abuse, anger issues and night terrors. And the medical records of Zed Rascov, patient since 49', highly intelligent, pyromaniac and megalomaniac.

A letter beside the window by Gordon claims that he saw the scarecrow figure in his nightmares. Behind the "Ginger photo" Crow's diary is found. Some days before present-day, he writes about feeling guilty to Gordon about a dead ginger girl named "Ginger". This person saw the scarecrow figure. After Gordon's session, he has himself locked in the basement of the Asylum. 

MC is hallucinating from the scarecrow doll. Klaudia is confronted, Gordon is now a janitor. Klaudia claims to not know Ginger and acts very avoidant. MC gets locked in Gordon's basement by a mysterious figure who lays a "GET OUT" scarecrow doll for the MC.

# Act II,III,IV
MC hallucinates more, she Gordon's TO-DO list of planting explosives and bear traps. Gordon also tells her "I have to do it!" in an unhinged tone. Gordon also seems to have received a "DRINKER" scarecrow doll.

Gordon's diary suggests he also fears the Scarecrow killer, and is actively hiding and fleeing from him.

Gordon assaults MC and claims that the arson and killer is Raicov, who he intends to kill.

Gordon intends to blow up the Asylum from within using dynamite and nitroglycerin. Seems that Gordon was present during the fire, while drunk, he failed to extinguish it with water because the valve was unkempt and wouldn't budge.

Gordon keeps articles about Raicov's arrest. He was an arson in a weird costume, taken to the Asylum. Gordon claims that Raicov killed Crow and burned the Asylum in 1950, possibly killing Ginger. 

MC and Owen apprehend Gordon before he sets off the bomb. He supports that Raicov caused the infamous fire of 48 and the Asylum fire of 1950, which killed Ginger Bellows.

The scarecrow shows up and kills Gordon, while using tranquilizing gas on MC&Owens. 

Klaudia denies everything and calls them crazy. She issues an employee, Mr. Piggs to open the courtyard for investigation, Mr. Piggs is a prick.

MC pays attention to a "Robin&Ginger" drawing, she also hears Zed Raicov celebrate Gordon's death locked in his cell.

Zed was in trouble for his outfit and placed in the Closed Ward, where he was injected with sedative-X, which is a potentially illegal practice of Klaudia&Crow and they deny they use it (they do).

Zed was scheduled for lobotomy by Crow the same day Crow was killed (today).

MC enters the Closed Ward and meets a lunatic patient and Zed. Zed is crazy and warns about the killer. Mr. Piggs escorts MC out of the closed war.

MC visits the library and comes across 3 patients. Nurse Ashley is said to be double faced. MC passes out and Mr. Piggs locks her in the cell next to Zed.

# Act V, VI, VII
MC talks to Zed, who helps her get out of the cell. Apparently the killer is Robin, Ginger's dear childhood friend at an orphanage. The scarecrow costume is the one Zed got caught committing Arson 6 years before. 

MC spots the killer who beckons they will kill Owens next. MC leaves the cell, finds Owens nearly unconscious warning her about Klaudia.

Apparently Owens was arguing with Mr. Piggs, After Piggs opened a "USELESS" doll he went insane and nearly killed Owens after he slammed his head into the window and attempting to kill him. The killer came in and killed Mr. Piggs leaving Owens alive.

Crow used to hypnotize Zed. Looking at Klaudia's transactions, we can see a $1k possible bribe with the head of the fire department. Suggesting a conspiracy, in official documents, there was no arson in 1950.

Crow sent to Klaudia about his disappointment in her bribing to cover up the arson story.

Klaudia takes a lethal overdose of sedative-X. She tells the story:
Zed caused the fire, Ashley ran into the chapel and burned alive. All of the staff blame themselves for her death. 

Klaudia dies. Ashley, the last surviving staff, escorts MC out the chapel and takes Owens for treatment.

In Klaudia's office MC finds a notice to Ashley about being violent towards the patients. Another note makes MC deduct that someone that's not Gordon, Mr. Piggs, Crow stole Zed's scarecrow costume. A picture shows Zed to be conspiring with the Scarecrow killer.

MC calls for help and evacuation from the island. Owens is hypnotized and locks MC in Ashley's room, it can be seen that Ashley's uniform is taken off.

It's obvious at this point that Ashley is the killer. In her basement MC finds out that Ashley is Robin, who assaulted a nurse and stole her identity. There's an article about Ashley being assaulted weeks before present day.

MC escapes the room but is stopped by Ashley and Zed, Zed knocks Ashley out and sets the building on fire.

Ashley helps MC escort out the patients and put out the fire. They find Zed and his bomb. Zed breaks free and kills Ashley but is tased and arrested.
