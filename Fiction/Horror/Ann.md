weow.

Ann is a student majoring in Digital Arts.
MISSING: male student, Hinata, Kurenai 

Ann lost her flash drive in her classroom, school closes at 9PM.

(Due to lack of funding?) Principal locks the school, Ann has fallen asleep in the class and she wakes up at midnight, where the school appears to have transformed into a haunted facility.

There's 3 Paintings of teenagers on the hallway wall, "Myra Hess", "Charles Worth", "Hana"<- This one is sinister looking and an empty "Ann" portrait.

- Chapter 1 - The Piano Department

(Okay, Kino prediction: People in the paintings are students from each department consecutively, starting from Myra = Music and on. Oh, nvm, they are the hinata, Kurenai students that are missing lol. aaaand I was right.)

Ann meets a pianist student "Myra Hess", who did the same, stayed locked in school. She has no eyeballs. Someone named Ivy, drugged her and plagiarized her piece of music.

Ann meets a security guard who is employed by the Principal to investigate the haunted school. There is a secret paranormal incident that happens after midnight, where the school transforms into the haunted facility. The principal keeps this a secret (he sure did not check for students left in the building very cautiously though...)

There is a dangerous girl that roams around the school, also. The guard doesn't say his name.

- Chapter 2 - The sculpting Department
A figure seems to creep behind Ann&co

They get chased by a an artwork named 'failure', and once they evade it, they rest.

A flashback occurs, of Ann's parents disappointed in her school performance. They seem to have had a limited time around her from a busy work schedule. Ann has a learning disability, but her parents didn't want to send her to a special needs school. Her parents then left her at an orphanage and possibly divorced.

The security guard reveals to Ann that he is specifically employed to guard the haunted hours (big waste of money lol). He notifies that time in school ranges from a 1 hour night to a 48 hour night. As soon as dawn arrives, the school becomes normal.

(I guess the girl roaming around was just for the sculpting department, and probably "Hana".

They meet Charles, who is a humorous enemy that knows the security guard. A long fun chase sequence with electronic music follows.

Ann passes out/falls asleep

- Chapter 4 - The Exhibition Hall

Security guy goes on an expedition and leaves Ann behind. Ann screams for him after spotting Hana.

They find the principal's secret tape. Apparently he was taking sexual bribes with students to promote their artwork. After the student "Hana" videotaped his wrongdoing, he murdered her. Hana vowed to haunt the school and kill the principal.
