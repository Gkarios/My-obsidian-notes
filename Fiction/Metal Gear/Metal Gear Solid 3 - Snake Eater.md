# Intro 
## Opening
1964 - After WWII the world was split to two -- East and West. This marked the beginning of the Cold War.

- August 23 1964, Pakistan
(In 1964 [Pakistan was south of the Soviet Union](https://cdn.britannica.com/66/64266-004-4C9A0511.gif))

In an American aircraft with the FOX logo, we see ZERO/Tom and Paramedic. Along with Snake smoking a cigar before he drops off to Pakistan, performing FOX's first [HALO jump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_military_parachuting).

Snake is 29 years old, born in Hawaii. FOX is working under the CIA and greenlit Major ZERO to perform the "Virtious Mission".

ZERO elaborates:
- In 1962
A soviet scientist requested (through an American spy) asylum in the West. His name is Sokolov, a rocket scientist working for a top-secret Soviet weapon facility as the East's foremost expert on weapons development.

- In April 1961
The Russians flew the first rocker, named A1/Vostok, build by primarily Sokolov. Sokolov was then promoted to the Head of the Soviet's design Bureau. He defected because he is afraid of his creations used in war. 

Sokolov, first managed to get his family to leave the USSR and enter the US. And then in another one of ZERO's operations, he had spies lead him out the Soviet Union, but in Western Berlin, he felt sick and stayed in a hospital for weeks. Then in October 1962, the [Cuban missile crisis began](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis). The Soviet Union intended to match the US IBMs in Italy and Turkey, by placing some in Cuba. President JFK, demanded the removal of them. And began a shipment blockade in Cuba. Soviets sent their ships regardless. 
A deal was signed for the Soviets to remove Cuban IRBMs in exchange for Turkish IRBMs. This deal was a kind of a US ruse, [the Turkish IRBMs were becoming obsolete anyway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PGM-19_Jupiter#Operational_deployment). In the deal, Sokolov had to be returned to the Soviets, indicating he was extremely important for them. Sokolov was returned and forced to work for a secret nuclear KGB weapon, which now, in 1964 is nearly complete.

Sokolov now contacted the US to rescue him. He is in Pakistan to build the weapon outside the research facility, which creates the perfect opportunity for FOX. 

Snake's mission is to extract Sokolov in a Helium balloon within the next 4 hours.


## Virtuous Mission
### Search for Sokolov
This mission is an international crime, if Snake gets caught, the US establishment will deny any involvement and claim he is an independent volunteer. Snake is given a **death pill** to avoid USSR torture. This potassium cyanide pill, causes the user to fall to a short false death for a short time. The way to return to a normal state is by consuming the **revival pill**. Which planted inside Snake's tooth. 

Snake introduces himself to the paramedic through telecommunications as "John Doe" or "Jack". Snake is an apprentice of "The Boss", a respected elite who got the US to authorize the Virtuous Mission. 

Snake talks to The Boss, who is essentially his "parent". This is the first time in 5+ years after her disappearance. She claims she was on a top-secret mission. The boss tells Snake to not have any personal feelings for his comrades. That he needs to be an independent soldier of tenacious spirit. Everything outside the self, is politics, which are protean. As a soldier, you don't take sides, but only ought to comply to given commands. 

A soldier is a political tool. Right or wrong have no place here. "Loyalty to the end", a person who isn't loyal is not a soldier but a man with a gun.

The boss is currently in the Arctic Ocean. Sokolov is in an abandoned factory in Dremuchij, USSR. 

- CQC
The boss invented CQC(Close Quarter Combat), Snake also helped her develop it during training.

- The Snake codename
Snake's codename comes from The Boss' unit named "The Cobra Unit". Which was formed to end WWII. 

- Major Tom codename
"The Great Escape" is a German story of 3 tunnels, one of which was named Tom.

- FOX
FOX is an unofficial espionage unit of Major Zero. If the Virtuous Mission succeeds, it will likely become an official part of the CIA. Zero has a vision to turn FOX into the biggest Spec Ops unit in the world.

Most of the intel is derived from The Boss'  private sources.
The Boss is responsible for the current development of SAS, German air bases in N. Africa and a dummy run of Heliopolis. Also researched for the HALO technique. Post WWII, the French did parachuting as a sport and The Boss was a tutor. She moved to a school in the US for HALO jumps. She made many contributions and nearly none of them are publicly recognized (probably intentionally). Zero calls her "The mother of Special Forces"


Snake sneaks past KGB troops guarding Sokolov's area, they are holding AK-47s and grenades. These troops are of the ninth directorate, which implies that Sokolov is of the utmost importance to them. Their director is a well known protege of Khrushchev (current Kremlin/President).


### Snake finds Sokolov
- Rassvet (Abandoned factory)
As soon as Sokolov hears Snake, he starts burning rocket plans.
Snake presents himself as a CIA agent, Sokolov tells him to hurry, because Coronel Volgin of the GRU (the Main Intelligence Directorate) is after Sokolov.

- Volgin
He is part of the provincial USSR authorities. He wants to overthrow the government using Sokolov's weapon, and since the JFK assassination, USSR foreign relations have become unstable, making this easier.

He wants to install Brezhnev and Kosygin in Kremlin's place. Who are politicians for the CPSU (communist party). 

He has control of another research weapons facility (OKB-812/Granin design bureau).

The KGB soldiers outside were actually intentionally placed to prevent Volgin from capturing Sokolov.

- **Your Russian is superb** 
Their conversation is dubbed from Russian. Snake is fluently bilingual, taught Russian from The Boss.

Snake speaks to Zero, who repeats that they've lost The Boss' signal, which already could be noticed by the player if they tried to call her.

<span style="color:brown">-{GAME ERROR}: "I had to kill them (the sentries)." I dazed them by choking, but Snake says "kill".</span>

Snake & Sokolov gets ambushed by a group of ninth directorate KGB soldiers, who believe that Snake is The boss, due to similar mannerisms. A man approaches, in cowboy boots spinning a revolver, said to be from the Ocelot unit of Spetsnaz (the Spetsnaz is special forces of GRU. So we know this person is tied to Volgin.). He is recognized to be the commander of the Ocelot unit, Major Ocelot.

Ocelot kills every ninth Directorate troop by himself in 6 quick lethal shots. Ocelot recognizes Snake is not The Boss. As Sokolov takes cover troops from the GRU unit appear. Ocelot in an attempt to shoot Snake, doesn't realize that his gun was out of rounds. Snake, knowing the model of Ocelot's gun, having counted the shots knows this, he abruptly grabs him and uses him as a human shield from the remaining GRU troops. He then tactically knocks out the rest of the troops one by one using CQC. Snake condescendingly lists Ocelot's shortcomings and recommends him to use a revolver, due to his recoil elbow twisting technique. Ocelot enraged tries to assail Snake with a knife but gets knocked out again. Snake compliments his shooting "**You're pretty good.**".

### Post Ocelot fight
Snake reports everything to Zero. They are both suspicious of the events that occurred.


#### Zero states the following:
- GRU
Military espionage outfit, the intelligence wing of the Soviet Defense ministry. Which competes with:

- KGB
The same thing as GRU but from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Snake is worried for The Boss' health.

Volgin was formerly in the Internal affairs ministry [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD). And notoriously took part of the [anti-guerilla ops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Guerrilla) in Ukraine and Baltic states. Claims responsibility for the death of 100,000 anti-communists. Instrumental in [putting down the 1953 uprising of East Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_German_uprising_of_1953)and [the 1956 revolution in Hungary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_Revolution_of_1956). 

Volgin's secret OKB-812/Granin design bureau research facility is directed by a man named **Granin**, who has hatred for Sokolov and has been a longtime arch rival. Since Volgin is anti-Khrushchev and Khrushchev takes good care of Sokolov, Granin teamed up with Volgin, to abduct him. Volgin also finds use in Granin's high-tech weapons to organize his insurrection against Khrushchev. Volgin now controls the Granin Design Bureau. Volgin might be betraying Granin. 

### Bridge
Snake catches up to Sokolov, who absconded during the ambush. 

He shows Snake the weapon he was building at the top of a nearby hill called **The Shagohod**, "the treading behemoth", a nuclear mobile tank capable of launching IRBMs autonomously. Shagohod is incomplete, its first phase has been finished, and now phase 2 has been commencing. Sokolov claims that Volgin can end the cold war using this weapon and begin WWIII. If snake extracts Sokolov, they won't be able to complete Shagohod.

As they cross the bridge, Snake notices someone approaching, it's The Boss.

The Boss demands Snake to bring Sokolov, as hornets surround them and a mysterious man, hanging from the hornets abducts Sokolov into a helicopter with 3 other weirdos. "All 5 of us are together again". "Is he crying" A masked ghost-man smiles as its raining blood and disappears before The Boss can see him. Volgin walks up.

The Boss defects to the Soviet Union and utilizes Sokolov for Volgin's acceptance. Volgin sees Snake as "another one of (The Boss') disciples." 

Snake steps forward and loses CQC to The Boss, she breaks his elbow. Volgin wants to kill Snake, because he knows intel that he can reveal to Khrushchev. The Boss tricks Snake into another stomach punch, as Snake grabs onto her headband getting pushed off the tall bridge into the river. 

Snake drifts away. He crawls out of the water and is given advice by the paramedic. 

He has a fractured left radius.
Deep bleeding cuts in the right upper arm, right forearm and left shoulder. 
Broken left ribs. 
Deep cut in the right abdominals.

Snake uses his backpack's aid equipment to treat the wounds and fractures.

<span style="color:brown">-{GAME ERROR}: Surprisngly, the bandages in the cutscene don't correspond to the wounds mentioned. :/</span>

As Snake sits there to heal, FOX sends an air balloon to pick him up. He sees many of Volgin's helicopters picking up Shagohod and moving it to the new base. The Boss (who's on a helicopter) and Snake stare at each other in forlorn and regretful expressions, reaching their hands to one another. 

A cutscene shows Volgin and Ocelot talking about a woman on board, who is Sokolov's wife.

Volgin makes a dumb decision to nuke the research facility, killing off a plethora of allied KGB soldiers and alerting the USSR. His 'brilliant' plan is to claim it was The Boss' nuke.


# Snake Eater
## Context
Snake's mission is to:
1) Rescue Sokolov
2) Destroy Shagohod
3) End the COBRA unit
4) Kill Volgin
5) Kill The Boss
This mission is code-named **Snake Eater**. 

- August 30 1964, Arctic Ocean
Snake stayed in an ICU to heal, as he was interrogated thoroughly for being an apprentice to the infamous The Boss, who defected from the US. 
Major ZERO and FOX are also inquired and lost credibility. But ZERO is optimistic that if Snake succeeds in another mission, they can clear their name and espionage unit.

August 29, POTUS L.B.Johnson received a call from Khrushchev about Volgin's nuke that destroyed the research facility. During that time, USSR intercepted the signal from Snake's aircraft. 
Khrushchev is aware that his chairman position can be overthrown during this crisis by the USSR, and asks Johnson for cooperation. Johnson informs him that Volgin, from the Brezhnev faction who opposes him, organized The Boss' defection. 

The Boss brought two experimental nuclear shells to Volgin, one of which was the one launched.

Khrushchev needs proof that this was pure defection and not a US order. So he threatens that within a week the US ought to take severe actions in favor of the USSR, such as killing The Boss, if the US fails to do so, Volgin's faction will overturn the USSR military and commence a new world war.

As Snake is the last surviving of The Boss' apprentices, he is entrusted for this mission. The KGB has provided FOX with communication satellites that allow for Snake to communicate with ZERO.

Additionally the KGB has provided them with two Insiders: **Adam** and **Eva**. After the defection of 1960 these two NSA workers moved in the USSR and trained under the KGB.

Adam has inflitrated Volgin's ranks and has an escape route for Snake. 
Snake's first order is to rendezvous with Adam.



- ZERO's code-name:
In "The great escape", the story based on true events about three prisoners who escaped from a POW camp in Nazi Germany, the prisoners dig three tunnels, the Nazis find the first two tunnels, but they escape through the third. The names were Dick, Tom and Harry. Apparently the third tunnel was actually "Harry" and not "Tom". Regardless, his code-name will be ZERO. ZERO comes from the letter "O" which is what he used to be called by his comrades, since his full name is "David Oh". O is close to 0, and 0 also implies anonymity, which is connected to his espionage operations. If the mission fails he'll be fired. 

-  Paramedic 
If the mission fails she will have her license revoked

- Sigint
The new radio helper, expert in latest weapons and equipment technology.

The Adam rendezvous is at the same factory Sokolov was in. His identity is confirmed by the answer to the question "Who are the Patriots?" "La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo".

Operation Snake eater is not a FOX stealth mission, but a US official mission. They want Khrushchev to know Snake is helping them defeat Volgin.

## Rendezvous
The Cobra unit is consisted of:
- The Pain 
- The End 
- The Fury 
- The Fear
- The Sorrow
- The Joy (aka. The Boss)

Snake will have to deal with Volgin's Speznatz troops from now on, they are said to be the best troops in the USSR. They carry Scorpions, which are similar to AK-47s but lighter.

The Boss needs to be killed assassinated to prove US innocence, because she knows top secret US intel and because she might more US officials to defect.

Near his crashed aircraft, Snake spots The Boss' horse. He encounters her, and The Boss beats him up again and tells him to quit his mission. She sets his jet on fire, causing a FOREST FIRE and alerting Volgin's troops. But The Sorrow makes it rain and puts of the fire, The Boss takes his tranquilizer gun and advises Snake to leave the USSR on foot. 

ZERO pushes Snake to keep going.

Snake goes to the rendezvous point, gets ambushed by Volgin troops but is saved by a woman who is not Adam and doesn't know the Adam/Eva password. She unzips her shirt and presents herself as Eva. She says to have defected to the USSR 4 years ago with Adam and gives vague answers. She knows Eastern techniques and is carrying a Chinese pistol, she gives Snake a .45 suppressor pistol that he loves. She also gives him scientist clothes and instructs him to go find Sokolov at the lab disguised as a scientist. She gives him analytical directions to the rear of the lab. She has to leave, as she "will make them suspicious otherwise", and gives him her radio frequency. Snake does not trust her, and is in a very sad and lost state, feeling like he has trust issues in general, after his dearest person, The Boss nearly killed him. 

Since Snake is still recovering from the bridge incident, he goes to sleep after given the orders from paramedic & Eva. The next morning the Ocelot unit has come to kill Snake. Snake distracts the unit for Eva to evade them. 

Ocelot grabs onto Eva in many ways, and smells her perfume, he's got himself a revolver but messes up the bullets again and gets rammed by Eva's German bike. Snake spares him again. Eva chases Ocelot. 


## Cave
The Paramedic has a talk with Snake about cloning human beings by replicating their DNA.

North, enter cave, aqueduct surrounded by mangrove, follow aqueduct to the north to the warehouse, then go north, then woods, and then lab.

Paramedic questions why Ocelot would be named after an American animal.

Snake gets leeches stuck onto his skin, he uses his cuban cigar to remove them.

Signit's name comes from "Signal Intelligence".

According to Eva during WWII, the German came upon 4,000 dead Polish in Katyn. This was a killing by Stalin, who had ordered NKVD to carry out the killings. Germany and the USSR blamed each other for it. Volgin would kill and beat to death prisoners in Belarus and West Ukraine.

Upon reaching the crevice, Ocelot ambushes Snake and performs a pistol duel with him. Ocelot loses, a storm of hornets appear and wipe out the Ocelot unit, as Snake is covered by aggressive hornets, he jumps down the crevice into a pitch dark cave. Eva tells the hornets are sent from The Pain.

In March 1 1954 Snake was exposed to a hydrogen bomb test at Bikini Atoll.

Major Ocelot is the son of some legendary hero, his mother was shot in the gut during battle. She gave birth to him during that time, and had her abdominals stitched up in the shape of a Snake. He grew up without his parents, raised by Volgin and GRU.

At the end of the cave, Snake easily beats The Pain.

## Lab
There is a sniper rifle on West Ponizovje, the aqueduct.

Snake finds Sokolov, his wife is called Tonya. Ocelot for some reason tries to Russian roulette Sokolov but The Boss interferes right before a lethal bullet would be shot out. Volgin shows to be aware that Khrushchev sides with Snake.

Snake can kill The End using an SVD sniper. 

Zero has doubts that Tatyana is a lover of Sokolov, his real wife is in the US and he doesn't believe he's the type of person who'd cheat because of their interaction in the Belgium hospital of Sokolov dreading for his wife and kids. Snake responds with "People change."

- Graniny Gorki lab
Attack dogs are guarding the place

Snake wears a scientist uniform and inadvertently Granin. In a drunk rumble he considers himself responsible for ending WWII (cope). He shows Snake Sokolov's Shagohod plans. 

Granin is selling Shagohod research to a US confidante, Huey Emmerich who had written a paper on robotic legs. His tweak on Shagohod is to use legs instead of tank wheels to allow it to tread on unstable land. 

Granin is sour that the Philosophers' legacy is handed over to Sokolov.

- Philosophers' legacy 
Volgin's father money laundered and illegally obtained the philosophers' legacy, making Volgin insanely rich and granting him a high position, since he buys the Soviet's military warfare and research.

They moved Sokolov to Groznyj Grad. Granin is flustered that Snake complimented his brown boots, he notes that he received them from Tatyana. He advises Snake to reach Groznyj Grad through the tunnel.

- The Fear
On his way through the forest, he kills The Fear

Eva has reached Sokolov.

## Groznyj Grad
Snake reaches the tunnel, past the Ocelot unit. He then climbs to the hilltop to rendezvous with EVA. Eva has scars all over her body she says Volgin did this to her sadistically, and that she is is "playing two roles". She is still very vague about everything.

Khrushchev is sending troops over. She sends Snake to Groznyj Grad weapons lab, where Sokolov and the Shagohod are located. West Wing Weapons lab. Eva tries to make romantic moves on Snake, but fails.

Volgin tortures and kills Granin, who was a suspected spy because the C3 explosives had went missing. He found a location transmitter inside of the sole of his shoe, which he received from Tatyana. Ocelot gets in a quarrel with Volgin over his reckless methods (murder of Granin and nuking of research facility).

The Boss announces that the US is intending to kill her and extract the Philosophers' legacy. Ocelot notices that Tatyana is wearing perfume and compliments her brown boots. Snake on his way to Groznyj Grad, kills The Fury.

Snake sneaks into Groznyj Grad and disguises himself as Major Raikov using his clothes, leaving the real Raikov passed out inside a locker. Tatyana threatens to kill Sokolov unless he gives her the Philosophers' legacy. As she leaves, Snake enters the room. However, Sokolov reveals that the Shagohod has been completed. The Shagohod can now launch nukes from 6000 miles (can strike anywhere in the US undetectable). 

Using this weapon, Volglin is intending to begin a worldwide revolution and turn countries into dictatorships. 

The only hope is for Snake to blow up the liquid using C3, which was stolen by Tatyana, who is also Eva! and not a lover of Sokolov. It's also heavily implied she's trusted by Volgin because of her continuous seductive behavior and acquiescence to his demands.

Eva told Sokolov that the Khrushchev sent her. And Sokolov gave her all of the Shagohod's experimental data. 

Sokolov has become completely nihilistic and depressed, he is not intending to return to the US to mass produce, nor help the Soviets. His motive was only to build space rockets, and not WMDs.

Volgin approaches. Apparently he's been in an open relationship with Raikov, and judging by Snake's genitals he can recognize he is a mole.

Volgin abruptly shoots both of Sokolov's legs, but is maneuvered by Snake and put to the ground with a gun pointed at his head. The Boss rushes and CQCs Snake, apprehending him. She also prevents Volgin from shooting Snake. Volgin starts beating and severely injuring Snake in a thrust of electric punches targeted at his stomach and cranium.

Snake is taken to a torture room, violently interrogated by Volgin. Suffocated, splashed with water, electrocuted in 10 million volts, wetting himself from the voltage.

Snake refuses to answer any questions about the CIA's knowledge and intentions. 

Philosophers' legacy is worth 100 Billion and in Volgin's possession in the vault of Groznyj Grad. 

Snake's body drops a transmitter that was planted by The Boss at the start of their Snake Eater fight, meaning that she has been tracking Snake all along. 

Volgin now distrusts The Boss and coerces her to cut Snake's eyes. The Boss turns her head over to Eva, who covertly nods her head in disagreement to the stipulation suggested.

As The Boss nearly stabs Snake's left eye, Eva grabs her hand. Ocelot disrupts by exposing Tatyana as a spy, he juggles his revolvers Russian Rouletting her, Snake through gut, kicks Ocelot as the lethal bullet is about to shoot Eva, the bullet pierces through Snake's right eye, permanently blinding it. Volgin -for some reason- is satisfied and leaves the room. Ocelot replaces the transmitter into Snake's back. The Boss shoots Snake's left leg with the **fake death pill**, at the same time, The Sorrow appears behind her carrying a 144.75 sign. 

## Waterfall
Snake is imprisoned and using The Sorrow's frequency he escapes from prison. Snake is followed by Ocelot's unit in the sewers and jumps off a waterfall.

On his way back, comes across The Sorrow, experiences a psychological life-threatening crisis. He gets insight The Boss was forced by the CIA to kill The Sorrow.

Snake reunited behind the waterfall. Eva again, makes one-sided moves on Snake. Snake looks really melancholic and traumatized from the past events (particularly The Sorrow and Torture chamber). This is followed by a comedic scene of Eva removing the transmitter from his back. Eva has stolen the C3 and Shagohod's plans and gives strategic instructions on blowing up the Shagohod. She additionally expresses how her fake personas cause her to be very lonely. 

## Shagohod
Snake sneaks back to the Shagohod lab and plants C3 bombs to destroy it. 

As he sneaks out, he is noticed by Ocelot, Volgin and The Boss. Snake loses CQC to The Boss yet again while the bomb timer is going off. The Sorrow helps Snake by giving him the time he has left. Volgin & co. concluded that Eva is a spy who's stolen the Philosopher's legacy because she smelled like bike gasoline. 

Volgin electrocutes and kicks Eva. He then takes a hold up to explain to Snake all of the lore about the Philosopher's legacy.

- Philosophers' legacy
During WWII US, China and USSR had a secret pact which aimed to beat Nazis/Japanese (Axis Powers). This pact amassed an enormous amount of money, research and covert operations. That fund is the Philosopher's legacy. Volgin's dad was in charge of handling the legacy, but he conspired to launder the money and allow the USSR to have total control over the Legacy. He transacted the money across many world banks, every transaction was stored in a film. After his death (somehow?) Volgin obtained the microfilm and inherited all of that wealth and built Graznyj Grad. Since Granin wasn't productive, Volgin took Sokolov from Khrushchev, who built the Shagohod. Volgin also had access to the WWII spy network and conspired with The Boss, so that she defects to the USSR, along with the rest of the Cobras.

Volgin gives The Boss The Philosophers' legacy. She takes Eva too, and whispers "Leave everything to me" to her. Ocelot nods to The Boss before she leaves.

Volgin and Ocelot quarel over who will fight Snake, he shoots Ocelot with an electric bullet. Ocelot drops Snake items and roots for him throughout the whole fight.

Ocelot doesn't follow Volgin's command to shoot Snake because he made a promise to The Boss.

Snake beats Volgin and runs out the facility before it gets exploded. Eva is takes Snake with her bike, send by The Boss to travel to a nearby Lake and try to kill her. However, Shagohod survived the explosion with Volgin inside of it. A long chase sequence happens. 

Ocelot joins, Snake saves Ocelot again. Volgin indiscriminately kills and rams over anyone in his way.

Eva has set C3 bombs under a bridge and they blow it up while Shagohod passes it, making it vulnerable to RPG-7 shots. They work together to destroy the Shagohod, Volgin uses his electricity ability to control the Shagohod but it backfires because as it rains, the electricity pulls a striking lightning, which sets Volgin and the Shagohod on fire.

Snake and Eva are chased by soldiers on flying turbine platforms and end up crashing and falling off a cliff onto the forest. Both are severily injured, particularly Eva, who is stabbed through the abdomen by falling into a branch.

## The Boss
Snake and Eva reach the lake. Eva leaves Snake to fight The Boss alone.

She shows up and talks about her dream of "The world being whole again.", she is hurt that America and Russia aren't cooperating like they were during WWII. She talks again about moral relativity and wants to reunite The Philosophers.

- November 1 1951
The Boss was in a desert in Nevada testing atomic bombs. "Nevada derives from Spanish, 'covered in snow... white as snow'. The Boss was drawn to Snake because he was a test subject for atomic weapons. She felt like he was being used by others similarly to her."

- 1960
The Boss went to space and got her vision for the Earth's future. 

- 1963
USSR launched the first satellite. US started the Mercury Program in response. Among chimpanzees for some reason they wanted a human test subject as well, and so they chose The Boss, exposing her to heavy radiation for a second time in her life. This was event was undocumented. The Boss didn't like the competition between USSR/US, she views them as the same.

-1961 
She was sent to Cuba under the CIA to take exiles back to their country. But the US government betrayed them, the president (JFK or Eisenhower???) withdrew their air support, and the exiles were killed by the Cuban army. This made The Boss lose trust in the US government. 

- 1962
The Boss is commanded by The Philosophers to kill The Sorrow, her old Soviet lover. 

Early 1900s China & USSR started the Wisemen's Committee, which was an older version of The Philosophers. All of the members had died by the 1930's. The organization went corrupt and formed into The Philosophers, people who love war. She believes that this establishment will be a never ending spiral of war and conflict. Her dad, one of the members, taught her this. She is the last remaining child of The Philosophers. Her dad, was killed by the organization for whistleblowing this information. In 1944 The Cobras fought at Normandy. The Boss was pregnant with The Sorrow's baby boy. The child was taken by The Philosophers. She unbuttons her shirt to reveal an "S" Scar across her chest and belly. "They took everything from my insides, slithering like a snake" as she points to the scars. 

The Boss declares their battle, saying that whoever survives will live to watch endless wars. She has also commanded MiGs(Russian aircrafts) to bomb the place in 10 minutes killing both of them.

Snake beats The Boss, she handles him The Philosophers' legacy, her gun ("The Patriot") and commands him to kill her.


# Ending
## Eva
Eva flies a depressed Snake back home. Ocelot interjects and enters their aircraft (somehow managing to go even with Snake in melee combat even though he just beat The Boss...). They play around with empty revolvers. Ocelot reveals that his name is **Adam**ska. He tricks Snake with blank bullets and jumps off the ship with a smile on his face.

Right before Russian aircrafts shoot down Snake and Eva, they are ordered by Khrushchev to retreat. 

Snake and Eva arrive at Alaska and fuck. The next morning Snake discovers a tape from Eva and listens. Eva harps on the irony of her tricking Snake and the juxtaposition of their names in the christian bible.

Eva apparently wasn't working for Krushchev, nor was a KGB spy and never had worked for the NSA. She is a Chinese spy who was sent to steal the Philosopher's Legacy from Volgin. The real Eva was a man (who has never been revealed in the franchise, therefore Eva generally refers to this Chinese spy). She also stole the Shagohod data for the Chinese to construct deterrent nukes to rival both the US and USSR. She grew up in a Chinese-Soviet-US Philosophers' school to become a trained agent.

The Boss, having trained in a similar facility, immediately could tell she was a spy and so she revealed her true intentions to Eva and instructed her to tell the truth to Snake after the mission was over. Since Eva's mission was to kill everyone who learned the truth about The Philosophers, she was supposed to kill Snake, but didn't, because of her promise to The Boss.

## The Boss
Eva continues, The Boss never betrayed the US. In the meanwhile, a scene of Snake entering the white House is playing. Snake meets US president Johnson and is congratulated by everyone. He is granted a medal, being considered braver than The Boss, and given the title "Big Boss", a true patriot. 

Big Boss hesitantly gives president Johnson a handshake being pressured by his surroundings. He looks very unhappy and wants to leave. He refuses to shake the hand of [John McCone, the CIA director](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._McCone)by virtue of his disappointment towards him. FOX is promoted as part of the CIA regardless. 

The Boss' defection was a ruse set up by the US government with the objective to obtain the Philosophers' legacy and deny it from the USSR and China and destroy the Shagohod. Volgin's nuke almost ruined the plan. Consequently, the US ordered The Boss to get killed by a US agent to prove America's innocence. 

The Boss will now always be considered a terrorist war criminal who nuked Russia and betrayed the US. She couldn't have told Big Boss herself to ensure he'd kill her.

"History will never know what she did. No one will ever learn the truth. Her story... her debriefing... will endure only in your heart. Everything she did. <span style="color:brown">GAME ERROR: "S" not capitalized! -></span> she did for her country. She sacrificed her life and her honor for her native land. She was a real hero. She was a true patriot."

Big boss in the cemetery is standing in front of the engravings:
