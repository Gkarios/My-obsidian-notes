### The Wars of Trump
#### Syria
Assad got confidence from Trump's non-interventionism. The worst gas-attack with 100+? dead in 6 years occurs in Syria. Trump got embarrassed and demanded the Pentagon assassinate Assad. But the Pentagon rejected it not wanting to start a war with Syria. Therefore, Trump sticked to tomahawk missiles. He bombed Syria hoping that Assad would be assassinated, being significantly more hawkish than Obama, who he criticized. "It may extend to Syria's allies, Iran and Russia.".

In April 2017, after another gas attack in Syria by Assad. Trump bombed Syria in higher frequency until he was talked down by the Secretary of defense. Russia commenced a disinformation campaign, until the alt-right  (Infowars, Paul Watson) began to criticize Trump. 

Now that Trump is being painted as pro-war by Russia and losing popularity, he does a 180, and withdraws troops from northern Syria.

The Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish forces that were being backed by the US for years had now successfully pushed Isis out of Iraq. Trump had a choice to back them up and spend on the forces, to stabilize Syria or to abandon them and let them be killed by Assad and the Turks. Trump chose the latter, which killed 1,000 troops and PoW lives by opposing forces including radical Al-Qaeda affiliated fighters. Also creating 300,000 refugees.

This caused Trump to appear treasonous to US allies. As a response he did another 180 and commanded troops to remain in the region to disrupt remnants of ISIS and he tariffed Turkey.

#### Saudi Arabia
Saudi leader asked Trump in a meeting to concur to the blockade to Qatar, which was the major source of extremism. 

Trump then endorsed this blockade, without the state Department of US's consent. The Secretary of State condemned the blockade. The pentagon also condemned this action by Trump, since US's biggest airforce base in the Middle East is located in Qatar (Al Udeid), which Trump had now blocked.

#### Gaza
Donald Trump in agreement with Netanyahu, moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to East Jearusalem, which signals that the US agrees with the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem. 

Gaza broke in large protests, which the IDF had to contain (The Great March of Return) "The most violent day in 6 years" (223 protesters died, 9,200 injured)

This gave Hamas credibility, and increased worldwide polarization/sympathy for the Palestinians.

#### Iran
Neocons and Israel wanted Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. Iran could now freely hurl towards nuclear weapons with no pressure. After withdrawing from the deal, Trump discredited Iran's leadership. Then, Iran proxies started attacking Saudi Arabian oil refineries, The Ayatollah sent the reigns to the IRGC, who launched attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. 

Iran was not willing to change any terms of the nuclear deal. As fuel prices went up by 200%, protesters in Iran's capital began to riot against the US embassy, breaking into it.

Iran freely bombs Saudi oil refineries in September 14 2019, disrupting 5% of **global** daily oil supply. Trump retaliated and issued an assassination of the major general to the IRGC, Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.

COVID-19 hit and tamped down the conflict.

#### Libya
Libya had an inner conflict during their election, which nearly sparked a civil war between two legislative bodies of the country, along with the military.

Khalifa Haftar, a long-time politician, took control of the Army and sided with the side of the House of Representatives, wanting to take complete control of the country, eventually by force, against the GNC which used to be in line in 2015 with the UN backed government "Tripoli", which was anti-terrorist and for securing Libya's oil resources. 

Saudi, Emirates and Egypt all agreed with the plan, and made a deal with Macron, the PM of France to facilitate this. Probably in exchange for oil contracts and stability of imported migrants from Libya. 

The Saudis also met with Putin, who supported the revolution, possibly opting for Russian influence over Libya. Putin enlisted the infamous oligarch, Yevgeny Prigozhin along with the mercenary Wagner Group to facilitate this along with the other countries.

Haftar asked Trump in a phonecall to publicly endorse this revolution. Trump characterized it as an "anti-terrorist" effort and publicly endorsed it.

The war started, between Haftar's House of Representatives and military against Libya's GNC (General National Congress) had begun. The GNC was being supported by Qatar, Some of Egypt and Erdogan. Italy supported Erdogan and the GNC, opting for less immigration from Libya.

This war led to the deaths of 10,000 people. The media did not care, Trump did nothing about it.

#### Afghanistan
Obama had pulled out most of the troops from Afghanistan by 2016, believing it was a failed war, which would reduce budget. 

Trump, did nothing and had no plan for this for 3 years, draining the budget needlessly, significantly reducing funding or pulling troops. In February 2020, Trump did not negotiate a deal with the Afghan government, he just decided to directly make the deal with the Taliban, for the US to surrender and fully withdraw from Afghanistan on May 1st 2021, after the election. 

November 2020, Joe Biden is declared the upcoming President. Donald Trump **deliberately sabotages** the deal he made in February. 

During this time, before Biden's presidency Trump purges the Pentagon and hires a new class of loyalists, he commands them to remove as many US troops from Afghanistan as precipitously as possible. Joe Biden's presidency begins and is forced in a dilemma. To either withdraw the unsustainable small deployment before Afghanistan is secure against the Taliban, which will lead to an immediate collapse, or redeploy troops that Trump pulled to facilitate a sustainable government first, which will require funding, during a Covid crashed economy and break Trump's deal with the Taliban, escalating the tensions.


#### Ukraine / Israel
Both of these wars were happening under Donald Trump's whole presidency. Crimea was annexed by Russia with live conflict. Donetsk and Luhansk were in active conflict between Ukraine and Russia.

The Gaza blockade was escalating, with record protests. The West Bank had the same settlements as after his presidency. Donald Trump, through bad media information was exonerated for every-single one of these wars and conflicts, while the opposite occurred for the following presidency. 

#### Bonus 
Trump supported the Bush war of Iraq and lied about it endlessly during his campaigns and debates with Clinton.

Why were there at least 140 contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials? Why did Trump pardon Paul Manafort? 

North Korea freely continued ICBM testing, with no pressure.
