### The Wars of Trump
#### Syria
President Donald Trump was considered the non-interventionist peaceful President to vote for, instead of the Hawkish Hillary, who had 8 years of foreign policy experience as Secretary of State. 

Trump's non-interventionist stance gave Iraqi leader Assad confidence. Assad freely facilitates the worst gas-attack in 6 years for Syria, infamous for gas-attacks (100+ dead). Trump got embarrassed and demanded from the Pentagon to assassinate Assad. The Pentagon rejected his demand not wanting to start a war with Syria. Trump takes solo leadership and bombs Syria using tomahawk missiles with no support. He bombed Syria hoping that Assad would be assassinated, being significantly more hawkish than Obama, who he criticized. Not to mention liability and expert commentary like: "It may extend to Syria's allies, Iran and Russia.".

In April 2017, after another gas attack in Syria by Assad. Trump begins to bomb Syria in higher frequency until he is talked down by his Secretary of defense. Russia commences a disinformation campaign, which causes many commentators from the alt-right  (Infowars, Paul Watson) to begin to criticize Trump. 

Now that Trump is being painted as pro-war by Russia and losing domestic popularity, he does a 180, and withdraws troops from northern Syria.

The Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish forces that were being backed by the US for years had now successfully pushed Isis out of Iraq. Trump had a choice to back them up and spend on the forces, to stabilize Syria or to abandon them and let them be killed by Assad and the Turks. Trump chose the latter, which lead to the death of 1,000 troops and PoW's lives by opposing forces including radical Al-Qaeda affiliated fighters. Also creating 300,000 new refugees from Syria.

This caused Trump to appear treasonous to US allies. After more push back, he does another 180 and commands troops to remain in the region to disrupt remnants of ISIS. Erdogan takes a stance against him and Trump tariffs Turkey.
#### Saudi Arabia
The Saudi leader asked Trump in a meeting to concur to the blockade to Qatar, a government which was the major source of extremism globally. 

Trump endorsed this blockade without the state Department of US's consent. Trump's Secretary of State condemned the blockade, along with the Pentagon since US's biggest air-force base in the Middle East is located in Qatar (Al Udeid), which Trump had now blocked.

#### Gaza
Donald Trump in agreement with Netanyahu, moved the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to East Jearusalem, which signals that the US agrees with the Israeli annexation of East Jerusalem. 

Gaza broke in large protests, which the IDF had to contain (The Great March of Return) "The most violent day in 6 years" (Overall, 223 protesters died, 9,200 injured)

This gave Hamas credibility, and increased worldwide polarization/sympathy for the Palestinians.

#### Iran
Neocons and Israel wanted Trump to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal. After withdrawing from the deal, Trump discredited Iran's leadership. Iran proxies started attacking Saudi Arabian oil refineries, The Ayatollah sent the reigns to the IRGC, who launched attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf. 

Iran could now freely hurl towards nuclear weapons with no pressure.

Iran was not willing to change any terms of the nuclear deal. As fuel prices went up by 200%, protesters in Iran's capital began to riot against the US embassy, breaking into it.

Iran freely bombs more Saudi oil refineries in September 14 2019, disrupting 5% of **global** daily oil supply. Trump retaliated and issued an assassination of the major general to the IRGC, Qasem Soleimani in January 2020.

COVID-19 hit and tamped down the conflict.

#### Libya
Libya had an inner conflict during their election, which nearly sparked a civil war between two legislative bodies of the country, along with the military.

Khalifa Haftar, a long-time politician, took control of the Army and sided with the side of the House of Representatives, wanting to take complete control of the country, eventually by force, against the GNC which used to be in line in 2015 with the UN backed government "Tripoli", which was anti-terrorist and for securing Libya's oil resources. 

Saudi, Emirates and Egypt all agreed with the plan, and made a deal with Macron, the PM of France to facilitate this. Probably for better oil contracts and a reduction of imported migrants from Libya. 

The Saudis also met with Putin, who supported the revolution, possibly opting for Russian influence over Libya. Putin enlisted the infamous oligarch, Yevgeny Prigozhin along with the mercenary Wagner Group to facilitate this along with the other countries.

Haftar asked Trump in a phonecall to publicly endorse this revolution. Trump characterized it as an "anti-terrorist" effort and stayed silent.

The war started, with one side being Haftar's House of Representatives and military, and the other being Libya's GNC (General National Congress). The GNC was being supported by Qatar, Some of Egypt and Erdogan. Italy supported Erdogan and the GNC, opting for less immigration from Libya.

This war led to the deaths of 10,000 people. The media barely reported on it, Trump did absolutely nothing about it.
#### Afghanistan
Obama, unlike the previous adminstration believed that the Afghanistan war was a failure. By 2016, he had pulled out most of the troops from Afghanistan, also allowing for a less budget. 

Trump, did nothing and had no plan regarding this war for the first 3 years of his presidency. He drained the budget needlessly, when he had the option to significantly reduce funding or pull troops. 

In February 2020, Trump did not negotiate a deal with the Afghan government, he instead decided to make the deal directly with the Taliban. The deal was for the US to surrender and fully withdraw from Afghanistan on May 1st 2021, after the upcoming election. 

November 2020, as Joe Biden was the president-elect, Trump shamelessly **deliberately sabotages** the deal Afghanistan he made in February. 

During this 2-month period, before Biden's inauguration, Trump purges the Pentagon and hires a new class of loyalists. He commands them to remove as many US troops from Afghanistan as precipitously as possible. Joe Biden's presidency begins and he is forced to a new dilemma:
To either withdraw Trump's unsustainable small deployment before Afghanistan is secure against the Taliban, which will lead to an immediate collapse. Or to redeploy troops that Trump pulled to facilitate a sustainable government first, which will require funding during a Covid-crashed-market-shutdown, and will countermand Trump's deal with the Taliban, escalating the tensions between the US and the Taliban.


#### Ukraine / Israel
Both of these wars were happening under Donald Trump's whole presidency. Crimea was annexed by Russia with live conflict. Donetsk and Luhansk were in active conflict between Ukraine and Russia. During his presidency, for the first time, Russian troops were engaging in combat in the Donbas in Ukraine 

The Gaza blockade was escalating, with record protests. The West Bank had the same settlements as it had after his presidency. 

Donald Trump, through unregulated media information was exonerated for every-single-one of these wars and conflicts, while the opposite occurred for the upcoming presidency. He cooperated with Netanyahu to cut UNRWA funds to the Gaza strip in 9/2018.

#### Bonus 
North Korea freely continued ICBM testing, with no pressure.

Trump supported the Bush war of Iraq and lied about it endlessly during his campaigns and debates with Clinton.

Why were there at least 140 contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials? Why did Trump pardon Paul Manafort? 

Trump chose to increase drone strikes in Yemen and hide the frequency from the US populous.
