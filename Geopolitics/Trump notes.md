- "No wars under Trump"
Iran attacked Saudi Arabia, oil refineries. Turkyie bombs Kurdish people. Assad gassed its people while Trump bombed their airport. The Great march of return, terrorist attacks and riots in Gaza strip. North Korea continued ICBM testing with no US pressure. Iran hurling towards nuclear weapons. Trump authorized drone strikes in Yemen. The Trump administration assassinated Iran officer Qasem Soleimani. He promised to end the longest US war in Afghanistan, and he kicked it down the road for Biden. 

These were building to the events 2020-2024.

Trump won the presidency in 2016 by 79,000 VOTES!!!!!!! 
And had 2.87 million less overall votes than Hillary. 

At least 140 contacts between Trump campaign officials and Russian officials.

If anyone makes this argument don't just give the cucked response "Well at least she conceded after".

  
Hillary on the night of the election didn't say any dirty quotes and neither encouraged any protest. The morning after the election she accepted the results and made a concession speech. During only the night of the election, did she hold doubt regarding the legitimacy of the results. This is because:

a) Voter suppression tactics like: brand new state voter ID laws, felon ineligibility that required fines and fees to be paid for voting rights, [ongoing investigations on massive voter purges](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/officials-investigating-why-126000-voters-were-purged-from-ny-rolls).

b) Russian interference:

Project Lakhta, an operation issued by Vladimir Putin, aimed to sabotage Clinton's presidential campaign. Russian hackers, affiliated with the GRU, hacked the DNC and the chairman of Clinton's campaign, John Podesta and leaked the Hillary emails and private files. Additionally, the Russian Internet Research Facility, a troll farm in Russia launched thousands of social media accounts to disinform millions of social media users.

Hillary, was not even charged for her emails. A mens rea couldn't be established that Clinton intented to conspire against her state, maliciously used confidential information or was complicit in a crime.

Clinton used an unprecedented irresponsible practice as Secretary of State. This is the full extent of her email controversy, the story with the most media coverage regarding the 2016 presidential elections.

Two fucking weeks before the general elections, FBI director Comey notified that he had begun his investigation on Hillary's spooky emails.

  

We know retrospectively from the 2019 Mueller report that Trump and his associates had 140+ connections with Russian nationals.

  

Hillary received 2.87 million more overall votes than Trump in the general election. Creating a new record for losing with the biggest popular vote margin.

  
Hillary lost the election for a total of 79,000 votes, spread across 3 swing states. Every vote matters.

  
Conceding this unprecedented election the next morning is something that takes balls, and a necessary quality of a US President.
