## Context
Destiny's [Debate with Ryan Dawson on Trump vs. Hillary](https://youtu.be/23FnhrdLL1g?feature=shared) is a polarizing debate that exposes a lot of the ammunition that lead to Trump's 2016 general election win. 

Ryan Dawson extensively talked about numerous conspiracy theories. I note down every single statement he makes. 
Note that I am not well versed on these wars, I could be missing important context:

## Very brief background research
### NATO bombing of Yugoslavia - 1999
- In 1999 Yugoslavia in Kosovo (before being a country in 2008) was ethnically cleansing albanians (848,000 expelled refugees, killed around 1800 combatants and 10,000 missing or killed civilians). 

- Having provoked condemnation from UN, NATO, etc. and refusing to sign a peace agreement by NATO, NATO anticipated that the situation would deteriorate without an attack. NATO issued authorization by the UN, but Russia and china vetoed. NATO, launched an unauthorized (first one in the history of NATO) bombing attack on Kosovo. NATO bombing killed 1,000 Yugoslav security force soldiers, and about 500 civillians. It destroyed a lot of buildings public and private. Ended the war.

###  US Intervention on Syrian war - 2014
- A Syrian civil war had started in 2011. In 2014 Obama officially intervened, with the aim of fighting the Islamic State (ISIS) and president al-Assad while supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces and rebels in the war.

### Sanctions on Iran
- Iran had violated international treaties related to it's nuclear program. Since 2005 EU, UN, US, later France, UK, etc. imposed sanctions on Iran for it's pursuit of nuclear weapons and non-compliance with international law. The U.S. has also imposed sanctions on Iran for other reasons, such as human rights violations, support for terrorism, and its ballistic missile program. The sanctions aim to make Iran comply with international norms and law. The US imposed restrictions on Iran's activities since 1979

### "The US placed Ballistic missiles on Romania and Poland to launch a secret attack on Russia"
- For the reasons mentioned before, Iran was a major threat. US build missile defense systems on Romania and Poland to intercept potential ballistic missile threats from Iran (and an army radar in Turkey). 
- These systems are NOT offensive. They are BMDs. Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense can only intercept short/middle-range ballistic missiles. They CANNOT intercept RUSSIAN ICBMs. These systems do not load offensive weapons like ICBMs, you need an entirely different system to launch missiles like that.
- This is a common Russia propagandized talking point.




## Debate Analysis
Dawson claims the sanctions and defense systems stemmed from **European** and **Asian** pressure to America with the incentive to profit from oil and gas from Iran. 
	He implies that Fukushima 2011 in Japan caused the **Asian** craving for energy sources, since they had to shut down nuclear plants. 
	He implies that the coup in Ukraine 2014 caused the gas to not travel to Europe and this caused **Europe**'s craving for energy sources

So this is why the "Iran deal broke out". Trump is of course **not aware** of this, unlike Hillary. He claims this based on her wiki leaks folder. In a Steve Hadley Middle East email. I managed to read through 3 emails containing pdfs regarding the middle east memes. None of it is anywhere near Dawson's claim, the emails are very short and vague, all public content. And also, have nothing to do with ballistic missiles in Romania or Poland or Turkey radar.

"America gets most of it's oil from Mexico, Canada, 12% of which is abroad." NOT TRUE, He is probably referring to Pesian Gulf countries from a 2012 source.

"It's not about storing the oil, it's about preventing them from selling the oil, which would give them economic independence from the IMF which aims to keep them in a poor perpetual debt scheme through loans."

The IMF has mixed results in poor countries, depending on the situation. Hilarious reach.

"It's also about the oil not going to China, that's why we invaded Libya."

The US intervened in Libya post Egyptian independence because of the brutal reaction of Gaddafi's regime to the protests that began in Winter 2011. Plus due to serious violations of human rights, United Nations established a no-fly zone and France, UK, US(26%) all sent troops. There's criticism in this intervention, Libya turned to shit and kept the violence regardless.

"They opened the Suez canal to Libyan and Iranian ships and Gaddafi signed 22 billion dollar contracts in oil with China"

There is no evidence of a 22 billion dollar contract in oil with China. Proof needed. However, 3% of China's crude oil imports in 2010 were from Libya. Again, nowhere close to the Dawson claim. hilarious that this 3% of China's import in 2010 is what is DRIVING US wars.

"And we put Al-Qaeda in charge, it's been a disaster, I had friends lol." "Third world cesspool, that was a disastrous war."

After the fall of Gaddafi's regime in 2011, many extremist groups were growing in popularity, including some of which who were associated with Al-Qaeda (like Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi). Al Qaeda was not in control. Just a lot of fanctions, many of which allied with Al Qaeda.

"US, especially Hillary made everything worse, gave power to Syrian rebels" "Hillary has been backing Ahrar al-Sham"

Hillary Clinton in 2011 claimed that the US should support moderate rebels in Syria, in order to oppose the extremist Syrian Islamic state and Bassar al-Assad. She NEVER referred to Ahrar al-Sham as moderate rebels. Her stance adapted to the situation as it changed. this is fishing for 2011 quotes of a war and independent rebel groups that shifted overtime. 

"(Ahrar al-Sham) in 2013 released Mohammed Zammar from prison" 
This was in 2014.

"Mohammed Zammar plotted 9/11. He was the moneyman for Mohammed Atta"

(Atta was a plane hijacker) There is no evidence that Zammar even knew about potential US terrorist attacks. Around 1998 Zammar became friends with Atta. Zammar boasted that he recruited the 9/11 hijackers into Al-Qaeda, though this is not actually confirmed. And again, would be before any plotting of US attacks. Absolutely stupid by Dawson to make this statement. 0 Evidence he was "the moneyman" as well.

"Hillary admitted she knew Qatar and Saudi Arabia were clandestine financing ISIS and yet continued to accept money from them and fight a war on 2 fronts."

In 2014, The European Parliament, Germany and the USA supported through intelligence that Qatar and Saudi Arabia were the main founders of ISIS. It's obvious that Hillary was aware of this. Dawson threw this to pretend a conspiracy was happening. What is interesting is that Clinton acknowledged that specifically US backed regimes in Qatar, Saudi Arabia also supported ISIS. Saudi Arabia had given between $10 million to $25 million dollars to the Clinton foundation, (not Clinton herself). The Kingdom of Qatar offered to give $1 million for the sake of Bill Clinton. Other countries the foundation accepted donations from include UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Brunei, and Algeria. A lot of this was before and after Hillary Clinton's time as secretary. Again, no concept of a timeline.

"This is as disingenuous as Iran-Contra"

Iran-Contra affair, was a secret political scandal during the Reagan administration 1981-86, where the US was facilitating illegal sale of arms to Iran. It was proven, unlike any of Dawson's theories.

"And that's (Iran-Contra) what is going on with ISIS, all the way back to neocons" "and the war of Iraq, which Hillary voted for."

This war was widely supported by both the public and the congress

"the real reason why we are going to Syria"

Dawson is appealing to someone that wrote a paper, mentions the Ghouta chemical attack in Syria

"Which btw, Steve Hadley, who is a director for Raytheon that advocated dropping missiles on Assad during the third gas attack which we were chemically scared that our allies were targeted"

The missile attack was a response to a deadly weapons attack on civilians which probably was issued by Bashar al-Assad.

"She is supporting Al-Qaeda"

"The republicans did this too, they financed Mujahideen through bcci and the saudis in the safari club"

The Soviet Union had a lot of presence in Afghanistan. In response to this, the US collaborated with Saudis to supply equipment and weapons to Mujahideen helping to drive the Soviets out of Aghanistan. It was done during Jimmy Carter's term and kept going during Raegans. This wasn't even a republican thing either lol.

"Trump said 'release the 28 pages'. The 28 pages showed that Syrian princes gave money to Osama basnan and Omar al-Bayoumi who acted as middlemen during 9/11 attacks"

This is **not** true.
In the 9/11 report of 2002, 28 pages were qualified as classified and not released to the public. Trump was not brave for that statement, most people wanted it declassified. Out of the 2 names Dawson brought up, neither of them were ever confirmed to fund any hijacker for 9/11. Again, utterly irrelevant even if it were true.

"Hillary is accepting money from the same people"

Only a decade+ off. No concept of timeline. 

"She continues to call Al Asham moderate rebels"

Not true.

"Bassar al-Assad is the most moderate rebel in Syria"

Wrong, al-Assad was highly authorotarian, violated human rights, and supported extremist elements like the Islamic State.

"Al-Assad was not using chemical gas"

All conspiracy, not substantiated.
