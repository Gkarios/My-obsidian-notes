### Brief timeline of the history 
- During the 1800s, the Area knowing as Palestine, was under Ottoman occupation.
- Since the 1880s Jews began legally purchasing land across Ottoman Palestine. This was absent of landlords.
- In 1917 during WWI, Britain announced it's support for the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, this was named "The Balfour Declaration". After WWI(1914-1918) the League of Nations (old UN), granted Britain the right to administer Palestine. From 1918 Britain transformed The Balfour Declaration into the Mandate for Palestine. Which also claimed would give civil and religious rights to non-Jewish communities in Palestine. This mandate took action from 1920 to 1948 (many riots came from Palestinian Arabs, which prolonged this), once Israel was established, Britain withdrew from everything. 


- 1947 Arabs did not want to give 56% of land to Jews (Mandatory Palestine). After the rejection, 1948 war happens, "The Nakba", Israel owns 78% of the territory by the end.
- The Nakba: 700,000 Palestinians forcibly displaced. 25,000 Palestinians dead. Diseases like typhoid.
- Israel invades Egypt in 1956 over the Suez Crisis, Egypt agreed to allow shipments and Israel pulls out in a week.
- 1967, Six Day War: Egypt, Jordan, Syria surprise invade Israel, get their asses handed to them.
- 1973 Yom Kippur War: Egypt and Syria surprise invade AGAIN. Lose, AGAIN.
- 1996 Qana massacre: IDF bombs UN compound in southern Lebanon over small fights with Hezbollah (1,000+ rockets fired from Israel, 100+ fired from Hezbollah). This shell killed 100 Lebanese civilians. IDF fucked up, and **lied** that it wasn't them.
- 2009 IDF deploys White phosphorous on Gaza. Reason: Tensions were high, phosphorous was used as a potential incendiary weapon and a smokescreen. Israel originally **lied** about deploying phosphorous. 
- Second Intifada caused the Gaza blockade.

### Apartheid
Arabs in Israel are most likely not living under an Apartheid, it's debated. Some points of arguing:
- 21% of Israel is muslim Arabs, Jews in Arab states add up to 0.0013%. By _any_ material measure, Arab-Israelis fare much better under Israeli governance than under _any_ neighboring Arab governance. Israel $54k GDP per capita daily wage of $50 for Arab-Israelis, $32 WB, $13 Gaza. 
- Israel replaced Second Temple with Al-Asqa Mosque and prohibited all Jewish prayer there. Arab Israelis serve in Parliament.



### Extra Notes
- Why was Gaza strip blockaded?

- Palestinian survey post Oct 7 attacks: 
"Arab world for Research and Development Al-Masayef, Kamal Nasser St., Building #43 Palestine 14/11/23"

- Palestinians exchanged water pipes for weapons.

- Fatah, Israeli Jihad, Hamas, PA

*"The Palestinian Crisis" (12/6)*

- Why did Greece support israel?

"Greece supports israel for foreign policy U.S. relations."

The 'Cyprus Problem' required good relationships between Greeks and Arabs. Also needed for low oil prices. 

- This is followed by a long compilation of out of context quotes by Israeli "Zionist" celebrities or politicians (not specified if they were even in office):

Lieberman 2018 quote

Anti palestine politician of 1968

Doron ben David anti palestine

Anti palestine Ram Ben Barak 2019

Seihis yassine? anti palestine

Movie Actor of "The real fauda" is anti palestine

more biased out of context quotes (scraped by so fast, couldn't write it down, literally: Name, Quote. No context for any of it.)

- Cherry picking history, without providing context for Mandate for Palestine, or any of the wars, but basically doing a Worst of Israel compilation throughout decades:

Assassination attempt of Yahya Sinwar (hamas leader)

"Middle east didn't want Palestine" (Essentially equating it to antisemitism in Arab countries)

"Arabs were at no fault during holocaust"

"Everyone felt bad for Israel after that"

"Greeks sucked up to Britain" ("Διττή πολιτική")


Assassination of Bernadotte (Which was committed BY THE STERN GANG (NOT MENTIONED!), and immediately condemned by Israel, (though partly and the culprits of the assassination were illegally pardoned.))

France supported Israel just to be competitive against the UK

Soviet Union puppet controlled US to support Israel.

_Agreed that antisemitism is prevalent in the middle eastern and Western world_

One of the three speakers was a Palestinian who cancelled the speech through Zoom during the meeting. Reason: "I can't be seen talking to potential zionists."

- Q&A - feeble pro-Israeli arguments:
"Mein Kampf was very popular in the middle east"
"No Holocaust statue in Thessaloniki, a lot of antisemitism there."
