## Intro
The US Government is consisted of 3 major branches:
1) The legislative: The House & Senate
2) The executive: The president/Police
3) The judiciary: The courts
## Passing a law
"Congress passes laws, but those laws end up boiling down to regulations that come from the federal government. In order for the executive body to execute on those laws, congress will charge the executive with an office, they will create an office, the executive can nominate the head, the senate confirms, and then the executive is allowed to create rules and regulations based off of those laws. It's called statutory interpretation, and it's literally the only way the government can function."

- Note: The other ways the government can function are through judicial review, public policy debates and legislative adjustments.

## Impeachment
Impeachment only refers to the formal accusation of removing a public official from office, not any further sentencing, those are civil/criminal charges.
The formal accusation is met through house majority. 
The conviction of the impeachment's trial is only met if supported by 2/3 of the Senate.

## Court Cases
In the US, court cases follow the syntax
"A v. B".
A: plaintiff (party that brings the case, issuer, petitioner)
v: versus
B: Defendant


Individuals issue civil cases, the government issues criminal cases
