### Ukraine Pre-Russian invasion
#### 2000-2010
- Early 2000 Ukraine was a post-communist shithole of a country facing a huge economic crisis. 
- President: Kuchma 1994-2004 was just exposed in long tape for soliciting bribes, threatening politicians, planning to rig elections, authorized selling an illegal weapon to Saddam Hussein and authorized the secret murder an opposing journalist "Georgii Gongadze". Who 3 months later was found dead in the woods decapitated.
- Riots began, 2 of Kuchma's subordinates were becoming more popular than him. 
- Yushchenko (PM 99-01)
- Tymoshenko PM for fuel and energy

- Kushma commanded Yushchenko to fire tymoshenko, and put her in jail. After the plan failed, he fired Yushchenko and replaced him with Yanukovych.
- That scandal also got exposed and Kushma, knowing that he has no chance of winning elections endorsed a successor, his current PM of 2002-2004 Yanukovych. 


2004 pre-elections:
- All Ukrainians speak Russian, 70% of Ukrainians speak Ukrainian. 
- 3 Parts of Ukraine: 
	- Far West: Ukrainian nationalists. Pro-EU (Tymoshenko)
	- Russophone East: Were the soviet union's industrial heartland. Pro-Russia (Yanukovych)
	- The Rest: Moderate positions. (Yushchenko, who was winning)


Since US was hated in 2004 for Iraq war, Yanukovych characterized Yushchenko as a U.S. puppet for being the neoliberal western type and for having an American wife. He also suggested he hated Russians and compared him to a nazi. 

(*ALLEGEDLY: Kuchma, having good relations with Russian politicians, convinced Russia to donate 300 million dollars in political campaign funds for Yanukovych*.)

Russia had the patriarch of the Orthodox church to endorse Yanukovych.
Yushchenko was then poisoned. His face became scarred and bloated. 

Yanukovych rigs the election and wins.

There was a 10 point difference between exit polls and official polls. 100,000+ people protested the results of the election. 

And so a reelection began, in which Yushchenko won, with Tymoshenko as PM. 

2 years later, Yushchenko fired her, for being a bad partner, and hired Yanukovych as the new PM.

2 years later Yushchenko fired him, and hired Tymoshenko as PM again, as the lesser evil.
Yushchenko was accusing her of being Putin's tool.

Since their partnership was so poor, Yanukovych had the popularity advantage and was elected President in 2010. And ran as pro-EU and pro Russian.

#### 2010-2014
One of Yanukovych's promises was to enter the EU. Yanukovych appeased to the Russians, signed a 30-year lease for the russian naval base in Crimea. Which made it impossible for Ukraine to join Nato (for the next 30 years). And passed a law that forbided joining new foreign alliances (like Nato).
Yanukovych jails Tymoshenko for treason, for (according to him) having negotiated a bad deal on purpose to make a secret bargain with Putin, becoming a traitor of Ukraine.

The EU noticed this, and stated that they won't let Ukraine join EU if they don't free Tymoshenko.

Yanukovych smeared Tmoshenko's name, which also undermined Putin's reputation. Deteriorating Ukraine-Russian relationships. Yanukovych tried to negotiate entering the EU. As a response, Russia starts sanctioning Ukraine in 2013 until it dropped out of the negotiations.

- EUROMAIDAN:
After a Yanukovych/Putin private meeting. Yanukovych failed the EU deal (allegedly, this was intentional and in the interests of Putin). Riots began, 3 politicians of the opposition were increasing in popularity. One of which was a Nazi moderating his positions for the public.

Riots increased, Yanukovych was going to start negotiating with the EU again. Putin now considers Yanukovych a traitor. 

Ukraine and EU threatened Yanukovych into signing a deal that would replace his subordinates. Yanukovych did not sign the deal being scared of Russian attacks. During the night, he secretly left Ukraine and was later seen in Russia. The parliament were voting to kick him from office, Yanukovych argued that it would be unconstitutional.

While Yanukovych was missing Russia's media made news stories that Ukraine was full of nazis and they would make speaking Russian illegal. Many small coups started happening in the russian-speaking cities of Ukraine and formed into small independent republics. Those republics asked Putin for humanitarian intervention. 

These protests in the south and east were a conspiracy funded by Glazyev (leaked phonecall). This plan widely failed, and the independent republics collapsed. The only that stayed was in Crimea. Russian troops started entering the peninsula.

Obama negotiates with Putin over returning Crimea. A referendum for moral autonomy started was cancelled, with one about joining Russia. Joining Russia wins 95% of the vote with 90% turnout. 60% of Crimea's population was ethnically Russian.

Putin comes victorious, having conquered territory wanted by Russian nationalists since 1991, his approval ratings increase, and Ukraine cannot join Nato for being in a current territorial dispute.

### War in Donbas
#### Maidan
After Yanukovych's complete failure of a leadership, missing from the country, Ukrainians, unable to impeach him, were lead to the **Revolution of Dignity** which aimed to establish a new interim government, which would be closely aligned with the EEA(European Economic Area).

Russia reported on the maidan as a "coup" with over 100 protester deaths and several police officer deaths, lead by nazis that would eventually opt to genocide Russians.

The new interim government was mostly consisted of Timochenko's party, and appointed without elections, Timochenko's deputy as the president, Turchenov (and Yatsenyuk as PM).

#### Russian filibuster
Putin: "The collapse of the Soviet Union is the greatest tragedy of the 20th century."

Russia secretly paid thugs to protest against the interim government and aimed to persuade Ukrainians into joining the protests. The protesters fought the counter-protesters over hypothetical policies spread by the news. And so the Revolution of Dignity was reported by Western Media as a spontaneous natural ethnic conflict inside of Ukraine, essentially the Russian reporting. Which fell under the same paradigm used when reporting previous Eastern EU conflicts inside the Balkans. 

Girkin, the defense minister of the **Donetsk People's Republic** that previously fought with Bosnian serbs, chechen wars and in the invasion of Georgia. Supporter of reinstating the tsar and turning Russia into an absolute monarchy that would reign over the former soviet union, was given a job as a security official by Malofeev, a billionaire far right banker, supporter of the monarchy. They launched a filibuster into the cities of Donbas, take important hostages, kill everyone defending, and invite local compradors who would pretend Ukrainians took over all by themselves.

This filibuster would allow Russia to send their military, "save" the south and east and annex it into Russia. Some of these takeovers failed, others succeeded, particularly Slovyansk. Russians already sent military waiting all around the border of East Ukraine waiting for the plan to take place, Ukraine had also sent military west of Slovyansk.

Girkin, followed through, invaded Slovyansk and framed it as a "Ukrainian invasion", along with the rest of Russia. Girkin abducted the mayor and locked him in a basement and undemocratically appointed a new soviet union mayor. Western articles like:
*"In Ukraine, armed men robbed the homes of several of the 150 Roma families in Slovyansk"* were being reported. Masked Russians robbed Roma families for money and gold. 

The soviet mayor made announcements like:
"Report any suspicious activity, like **speaking Ukrainian**". International journalists were disappearing, some were found disemboweled in bearing signs of torture floating on the river.

While Western Ukraine was furious about this, the local areas being invaded, were not, Russians immediately controlled the TV stations and news of the areas propagandizing the local population. People in the occupied territories saw it as Ukrainians escalating first.

In Western Ukraine a pro-Russia vs pro-Ukraine fight broke out, 6 pro-Ukrainians were killed by gunshots, pro-Ukrainians were going to burn a nearby Russian camp, the pro-Russians barricaded themselves in the building. Both groups were shooting and throwing molotovs at each other. The molotovs set the building onto fire and the fire, inadvertently blew a gas tank inside killing 80 pro-Russians inside the building. Russia reported this as "armed Ukrainians set fire to tents throwing grenades in the building." The Mossad, the CIA were blamed. Western Ukraine decided to deescalate matters. But the East saw this as a spiraling of the conflict.

Consequently, a lot of the Russian-propaganda influenced the West to sympathize with the Russian side.

- June 2014
Ukraine elects new President Poroshenko (2014-2019)

Western Ukraine felt empowered enough to claim back the regions, and establish a sovereign state. A slow war occured, Girkin could not maintain Slovyansk and asked Putin for help, Putin rejected. Girkin fell back from Slovyansk, but sent everyone to defend Donetsk, another captured Donbas city with 1 million residents.

As Ukraine finally took back Slovyansk, they found mass graves of executed innocents. The residents of Slovyansk were complicit only because they assumed Russia would be winning the war.

Note that unlike the Russian claims, Ukrainians did not massacre Russia-speaking residents even when complicit of these executions.

Girkin considered Putin a traitor and blamed him for the loss making a dichotomy in the separationist crowd. While Russia could once again, freely withdraw from Donbas with Crimea being annexed, they still decided to surprise attack Ukraine and invade deeper into Ukraine.

#### Invasion July 2014 - Feb 2015
The Russians killed dozens of Ukrainians in a surprise missile attack. And also shot down **Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 with a Buk 9M38 surface-to-air missile.** killing **300 innocent passengers, more than any Russian casualties throughout this war.**

Note that [Russian web brigades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_web_brigades) took action, editing the Russian Wikipedia coverage of the MH17 crash.

This incident caused the US and the EU to sanction major Russian companies in response.

Russia launches a Full-Scale Invasion of Ukraine. 4,500 soldiers with tanks, covering a portion Ukraine, circling around an area of Ukrainians, in which they killed every single civilian and combatant Ukrainian. 

Putin denied that they invaded and everyone believed them, calling it US propaganda with no evidence of tanks in Ukraine. Some of the Russians themselves had leaked their involvement through social media, and Russian tankers questioned by Ukraine also revealed their orders. 

Putin denied his involvement on the matter, and called them volunteers. The US took a neutral position and called this an "(alleged by NATO) Russian invasion". Every single mainstream publication except for Vox considered it alleged.

However, Russian soldiers themselves defected to the Russian army because of family Russian soldier casualties, and revealed to have been ordered by Russian officials as professionals themselves. Which undermined the Ukrainian "civil war" narrative entirely. While Russia could propagandize about Ukrainian deaths, they couldn't do it to Russian citizens.

Russian independent journalists were prevented from reporting, and impartial media was shutdown (see Boris Nemtsov assasination). 


Russia signed a deal to pull out of Donbas, if East Ukraine has more autonomy from the Ukrainian state. 

In spite of this deal, Russians still claimed that the troops in Ukraine were not professionals but volunteers, they kept giving them lots of rocket artillery. Late September 2014 the Russians in East Ukraine started firing and bombing the Donetsk airport from densely populated Ukrainian areas near the airport, that because of this war were all destroyed. In 3 months the Russian rebels captured the airport and killed everyone, (The peace agreement had been made mind you.)

In Jan 2015 Russians rocket attacked Debaltseve killing 31 civilians, 267 soldiers, capturing 120, wounding around 600. 

Russian attacks killed 12,000 Ukrainians.

Russia bombed Unity Rally 2/22/2015 killing dozens of civilians.

#### 2019-2022
##### Trump's first impeachment
In May 2019 Zelenskyy gets elected (yes, democratically). 
In July 2019 President Donald J. Trump orders an illegal investigation on his most likely political opponent in next year's elections Joe Biden [over his son's involvement in a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biden%E2%80%93Ukraine_conspiracy_theory). Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate by pausing US aid to the potentially corrupt country Ukraine. Specifically prevented roughly $400 million in military aid from entering Ukraine, raising security concerns. 

In September 2019 a whistleblower complaint alleged Trump's pressuring of Zelenskyy in the phone call to investigate Burisma in exchange for military aid to Ukraine.

In December 2019 The House of representatives voted as a majority to impeach Donald Trump from office on two articles:
1) Abuse of Power
2) Obstruction of Justice

This was passed to the senate in January 2020, which veto'd the impeachment (2/3 of the Senates needed, 52-48 on Abuse of Power, 53-27 on Obstruction of Justice. The Senate was majority republican, and as noted from the following republican campaign, republicans needed to stay loyal to Trump to have public support.) And so, Trump was not removed from office ([nor in his next impeachment!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_impeachment_of_Donald_Trump)).





### Nato Expansion
#### 1990 - NATO will not expand to the east.
James Baker (US Secretary of State) and Mikhail Gorbachev (President of Soviet Union) agree to let East Germany into NATO under the premise that NATO will not expand "one inch to the east" [full document](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/document/16116-document-05-memorandum-conversation-between). It is unclear whether this is referring to within Germany or the European continent. Importantly, Bush retracts this point immediately, before it's delivered. But because of a failure, Gorbachev still believed this was an implicit agreement (Not explicit however).

#### 1991 - Collapse of Soviet Union
Soviet Union collapses, coup happens. Russians declare a government of Russia. Ukraine declares independence 5 days after the coup.

#### 1994 - Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland
Not only did East Europe beg America to join NATO, but Poland **blackmailed** to join NATO. Bill Clinton was going to establish a partnership for peace inside Eastern Europe. However, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary wanted NATO's article 5. The President of Poland made Boris Yeltsin sign a letter **while drunk** that Russia consents to Poland joining NATO. Polish politicians threaten to interfere with the US elections in favor of republicans (who were at the time not in office), and coerced Bill Clinton into letting those 3 countries into NATO.

Russia was giving many mixed signals at the time. Their argument for not joining NATO was that they didn't want to fight if China attacks any NATO country.

Bill Clinton made a confidential deal with Yeltsin for $4 billion, and ensured that no nuclear weapons will move to the 3 countries. This was announced in 1996 to help Bill Clinton's campaign in the US general elections. 

All good and well this was until 2000 where both were replaced by Bush jr and Putin. Bush tried to get Ukraine and Georgia into NATO against the advice of France, Germany and his advisors.

#### 2008 - NATO = bad?
This NATO membership attempt was a catalyst for Russia invading Georgia. The NATO plan was heavily criticized by mainstream journalists. Obama/Hillary wanted to amend relations with Putin and scrapped interceptors from Europe. Obama retracted Bush's attempts and made 2 requirements for joining NATO:
1) Territorial Integrity
2) referendum

Georgia failed step 1, Ukraine failed step 2.

#### So why invade Ukraine?
Russia's invasion of Ukraine would not prevent Baltic countries from joining NATO.

Russia additionally interfered with the 2016 US elections (Russiagate). Which was another bad decision because it drove America to sending aid to Ukraine. Putin is not a genius, he is also affected by misinformation, and likely his invasion of Ukraine is induced by indecisiveness and panic.

Remember, in 2014, Yanukovych gets elected, and agrees to host a Russian military base in Crimea for the next 30 years blocking itself out of NATO until the 2040s.

Despite of the assurance that Ukraine couldn't have joined NATO, Russia still invaded Crimea and Donbas and blamed NATO and America for it regardless. Even during a time when America didn't aid Ukraine in any way. 


#### Aftermath
Russia invaded and brutalized a neighbor with a better reputation than before the invasion.

A high portion of the US and a plethora of EU parties were more sympathetic to Russia than Ukraine. 

Keep in mind for "the genocide of Russian speakers". The following grew up speaking primarily Russian: 
Tymoshenko, Poroshenko, Yarosh, Zelenskyy, Turchynov, Biletski, Semenchenko, Kolomoyski

During the Donbas war, US was more concerned with ISIS attacks and beheadment of Foley. The US at the time believed that Russia was in favor of stopping the invasion. Russia also launched propaganda like pizzagate. 

Note that many of Russian invasions and attacks had delayed reporting on the West, highly distorting time. 
(Crimea Invasion REAL: 2/24, 
"New Ukrainian Government appointed" REPORTED: 2/27,
"Yanukovych claims he was a victim of a coup" REPORTED: 2/28, 
Crimea Invasion REPORTED: 3/2. 
Notice how these are intentionally reported out of order, to first paint Ukraine as rogue, and then report on the invasion, to make the illusion of "retaliation". Even blaming Ukraine for not complying with the Minsk peace agreement.)

US now is taking the side of Ukraine, Ukraine is connected to the Western establishment. 

The popular populist anti-West establishment media, like Fox news host Tucker Carlson, Jimmy dore and MANY more, were in favor of Russia, believing they were being sold pro-Ukraine propaganda.
