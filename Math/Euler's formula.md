Calculating interest:
A = P(1+n)^n

In the annual context:

100% interest rate per year would be:
A = (1+1)^1
=2

50% interest rate twice a year would be:
A = (1+1/2)^2
= 1+2 * 1/2+ 1/4 = 2.25

25% interest rate 4 times a year:
A = (1+1/4)^4
= 2.434

Every month: 100/12% interest rate 12 times a year:
A = (1+1/12)^12
= 2.61

Every day: 100/365% interest rate rate 365 times a year:
A = (1+1/365)^365
= 2.714

e = (1+infinite)^infinite
