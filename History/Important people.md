## 1914 - Adolf Hitler
- Berghof, Germany

Hitler was the leader of the Nazi German party. In September 1939, he authorized the invasion of Poland, which marked the start of WWII. He was closely involved in military operations throughout the war and was the central figure of the Holocaust: the genocide of six million Jews and millions of other victims.

In 1913 Hitler left his home in Vienna to receive part of his father's estate in Munich, Germany.  He possibly left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austrian Army, he was arrested by the police but failed his physical exam and brought back to Germany, where he would paint architectural scenes. 

Next year, at 25 when WWI started, he requested permission to join the German army in WWI. Since he was Austrian, his position was an error by the government, he legally should not have been allowed to serve. Hitler fought in several significant battles during WWI, he refers to these years as the best years of his life. 

He was described by other soldiers as aloof, quiet, a loner, never receiving mail and reading a lot of literature and pamphlets. He held German nationalist ideas at a young age. Despite his oddness, he was liked. He received the [Iron Cross](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/German_Cross.svg/1024px-German_Cross.svg.png) for his bravery, effective service, and willingness to participate in life-threatening tasks. 

In 1919, he joined the German Workers' Party. In 1921 he was appointed leader of the Nazi(=National Socialist) Party. In 1923, he attempted to overthrow the government and come in power but failed. He was sentenced to five years in prison, where he wrote his political manifesto Mein Kampf(=My struggle). 

After his release in 1924, Hitler gained popular support after attacking the Treaty of Versailles, promoting pan-Germanism, antisemitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. He frequently denounced communism as part of an international Jewish conspiracy.

By 1932 the Nazi Party had the most seats in the German Parliament, but not a majority. The former chancellor and other conservative leaders convinced the President to appoint Hitler as the new Chancellor in January 1933. This transformed Germany's title from "Weimar Republic" to "Nazi Germany", a one-party dictatorship based on the autocratic and totalitarian ideology of Nazism.  

Once the German president died in 1934, Hitler undemocratically and unconstitutionally succeeded him. The public was not against Hitler for various reasons including political manipulation and propaganda.

Once in absolute power, Hitler implemented numerous racist policies, including the deportation or killing of all German Jews, deeming them as subhuman. His first six years resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression and the abrogation of restrictions imposed against Germany after WWI. This gained him significant popular support.

One of Hitler's key goals was to ensure a homogeneous living space for Germans in Eastern Europe. He did this by invading foreign countries like Poland. The invasion of Poland resulted in France and Britain to declare war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler declared war on the United States. By the end of 1941, Hitler occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In the following four years, Hitler became enemies with the Allied armies, now including the USSR. 

As the Soviet Army marched in Hitler's area, Hitler and his long-time wife, Eva Braun both committed suicide by gunshot and commanded his people to burn their corpses.

Hitler and his regime deliberately killing about 19.3 million civilians and PoWs. Additionally, 28.7 soldiers and civilians died as a result of the war he caused. 

WWII is the deadliest conflict in history.
## 1917 - Stalin

- Politician

Stalin was the Secretary of the Communist Party for 30 years and Chairman of Council of Ministers. He consolidated power to become a dictator by the 1930s. He established Stalinism, which is the totalitarian enforcement of Marxism-Leninism.

In his early life he raised funds for Lenin's faction through robberies, kidnappings and protection rackets, getting repeatedly arrested and exiled in Siberia.

Being part of Lenin's revolution, after Lenin's death in 1924, Stalin assumed leadership of the country. 

He created a centralized command economy leading to agricultural collectivism and rapid industrialization. 

Severe disruptions of food production contributed to the famine of 1930-33. One of which was the man-made famine of Holodomor, which forcibly starved to death millions of Ukrainians. 

Stalin's Great Purge/Terror used the Gulag system of forced labor camps to eliminate those deemed "enemies of the working class".

Stalin promoted European Antifa movements, particularly during the Spanish civil war, and aimed to establish the Communist International.

In August 1939, Stalin signed a non-aggression pact with Hitler which would allow Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union to establish spheres of influence across Northern Europe (Poland, Latvia, Sweden, etc.). The Soviets freely invaded Poland afterwards.

In 1941, Hitler was confident that he could take over the USSR and take advantage of its expensive natural resources and army. He invaded the Soviet Union and broke the non-aggression deal with Stalin. This got Stalin to join the Allies and repel the German invasion. 

By the end of WWII, Stalin had taken advantage of the war to annex the Baltic states and parts of Finland to the USSR. This expansion established the Soviet Union as a global superpower dictatorship. The world entered the Cold War period of tension between the US and the USSR.

The Soviets built an atomic bomb in 1949. During these years the Union experienced another national famine and a large state-sponsored antisemitic campaign. 

Stalin engaged in large amount of forced transfers of entire populations to ethnic groups and social classes accused of being anti-Soviet and deported them to poor territories as collective punishment. 

After the dictator's death, the next leader of Russia denounced his rule and ran on the "de-Stalinisation" of the USSR.

In Russia there has been a revival of pride in Stalin's legacy as a victorious wartime leader, who established the Soviet superpower.

In other parts of the world, and especially adjacent ex-Soviet countries like Poland and the Baltic states, Stalin's regime is often compared and equated to Nazi Germany. He is seen as a war criminal who caused mass ethnic cleansing, executions and famines which killed millions of innocent people.
## 1923 - Harry S. Truman
- Missouri, US
- Politician

Truman as president sent $13.3 billion to Western Europe to economically recover from WWII, established the Truman Doctrine and NATO against the rising threat of Stalin's USSR.

Truman fought as a captain during WWI and was later voted in the senate for 10 years. In 1944 Truman was picked as FDR's Vice president for 3 months, until FDR's death. 

Once Truman got into office to replace FDR, he was informed about the ongoing confidential Manhattan Project and the atomic bomb. 

The Japanese Empire, an ally of the then-destroyed Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, was an anti-Chinese Ultranationalist military dictatorship that conquered a large part of the Asia-Pacific. The Empire, motivated by ethnic hatred, committed countless atrocities and genocides like the [Nanjing Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_Massacre) which lead to the death of 200,000 civilians and mass rape of 20,000 to 80,000 women and children. 

Truman was consulted by Canada to take British consent to use atomic bombs against the Japanese Empire. After the British consented to it, Truman authorized the only use of nuclear weapons in a war in history. 

The US dropped two atomic bombs on two of the most important military bases of the Japanese empire. They deployed "little boy" on Hiroshima. Since the Japanese Empire did not surrender or declare peace, 3 days later the US dropped "Fat Man" on Nagasaki. These two bombs instantly killed 150,000-240,000 people and annihilated land.

The US psychologically terrorized the Japanese Empire, leading them to surrender.

Truman is known for being against protectionism and isolationism and working closely with Britain for internationalist foreign policy. 

He won re-election in 1948, oversaw parts of the Cold War like the Berlin Airlift and Marshall Plan. He helped South Korea repel the invasion of North Korea during the Korean War of 1950. Truman also proposed comprehensive civil right legislation to Congress. The Congress refused, and so Truman issued Executive orders to prohibit discrimination in federal agencies and US Armed Forces. The 22nd Amendment, enacting presidential term-limits was passed in 1951.

By the end of his term, Truman was publicly unpopular, because of growing inflation and corruption in parts of his administration, though not implicating Truman himself. Truman did not choose to run for re-election.
