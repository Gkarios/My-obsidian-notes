To Put it simply, the Bible should never be appealed to in any moral or logical argument. The morality of the text is inconsistent and unethical:

### Genocide homosexuals
- Leviticus 18 and 20

Main article: [Leviticus 18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus_18 "Leviticus 18")

See also: [Abomination (Bible)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abomination_(Bible) "Abomination (Bible)")

Chapters 18 and 20 of [Leviticus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leviticus "Leviticus") form part of the [Holiness code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holiness_code "Holiness code") and list [prohibited forms of intercourse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incest_in_the_Bible "Incest in the Bible"), including the following verses:

- "You shall not lie with a male as with a woman; it is an abomination." Chapter 18 verse 22 [link](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%2018:22)
- "If a man lies with a man as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination; they shall surely be put to death; their blood is upon them." Chapter 20 verse 13 [link](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Leviticus%2020:13)
### Women should not speak church
First Corinthians suggests that "It's a disgrace for women to speak in church. If they have a question, they should go home and ask their husbands."
### Virgin Mary is not a virgin
Virgin Mary was mistranslated from Hebrew "Young girl" (Alma) to Greek "virgin(celibate)" (parthena).
