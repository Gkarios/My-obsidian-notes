A vertex (κόμβος) dominates itself and all its neighbors.

In a graph G:

A set S of vertices of G is a dominating set if all V(G)(vertices of G) are dominated by S.

A min Dominating set of G is a DS of minimum cardinality. The cardinality is the domination number of G, denoted by γ(G).

Degree is the max number of neighbors for every V(G). 

γ(G) >= Degree + 1

N = |V(G)|: size of (network)

The greatest distance of two vertices εV(G) is the diameter of the Graph
