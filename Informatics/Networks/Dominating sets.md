## Vocabulary
m number of nodes |V|
n number of edges |E|

## Additional
- A vertex (κόμβος) dominates itself and all its neighbors.

In a graph G:

A set S of vertices of G is a dominating set if all V(G)(vertices of G) are dominated by S.

A min Dominating set of G is a DS of minimum cardinality. 

- The cardinality is the domination number of G, denoted by γ(G).

- Degree is the max number of neighbors for every V(G). 

γ(G) >= Degree + 1

The greatest distance of two vertices εV(G) is the diameter of the Graph

E ⊆ V x V

V x V is the Cartesian product of the set V with itself, which includes all possible pairs of vertices.
